[PAR] Gymnophobia can interfere with a person\u2019s activities, but more severely, it can decrease their quality of life.  People who suffer with this phobia may have experienced a traumatic event in their past that hinders them from being able to feel comfortable naked or seeing their own naked body.  They may feel an extreme anxiety when naked because of lack of protection, such as protection from clothing.  This can be attributed to a serious past experience. This fear can also be triggered by something a person saw on television or in a movie.  A public standard for modesty prevents public nudity, and those suffering from Gymnophobia might be extending that modesty to their private situations such as in their own home. Childhood Gymnophobia is also common due to peer pressure, bullying and fear of exposing private parts. Anything traumatic that is seen or happens in life can induce a downward spiral into a serious phobia.  But as with any phobia, there is help.

This film, in which she was reunited with her Paper Moon co-star/father Ryan O'Neal and director Peter Bogdanovich , may have represented the actress' best work, but few filmgoers saw it. By 1980, O'Neal was old enough to appear as a summer-camp girl determined to lose her virginity in Little Darlings , but her acting skills paled beside those of her co-star, Kristy McNichol . As O'Neal got older, the roles became less interesting and fewer in number. Though she didn't act much in the '90s, O'Neal managed to keep her name in the public eye through her marriage to tennis star John McEnroe . The couple had three children together, but the marriage ended in divorce in 1992. In the early 2000s, O'Neal found moderate success on the small screen, appearing on such shows as Sex and the City , Rescue Me , and Wicked Wicked Games , and even competed on the enormously popular ballroom-dancing competitive reality series Dancing with the Stars in 2006.

Known for his weird and outlandish subject matter, Dali's most famous work of art is probably The Persistence of Memory (1931), often called just \"Clocks\" and widely regarded as a Surrealist masterpiece. But what is the meaning behind Salvador Dali's painting The Persistence of Memory? What do all of those melted clocks mean? [PAR] Salvador Dali & the Surrealists [PAR] The meaning behind Surrealist Salvador Dali's artistic masterpiece The Persistence of Memory (1931) is not easy to grasp. In the painting, four clocks are prominently on display in an otherwise empty desert scene. While this might seem uncanny enough, the clocks are not flat as you might expect them to be, but are bent out of shape, appearing to be in the act of melting away. In classic Surrealist manner, this weird and unexpected juxtaposition poses a lot of questions right upfront. ",

Peron, a demagogue who came to power in 1946 with the backing of the working classes, became increasingly authoritarian as Argentina\u2019s economy declined in the early 1950s. His greatest political resource was his charismatic wife, Eva \u201cEvita\u201d Peron, but she died in 1952, signaling the collapse of the national coalition that had backed him. Having antagonized the church, students, and others, he was forced into exile by the military in September 1955.

While everything he does features a trace of his trademark sense of humour, he still manages to handle the more serious aspects of the film mostly thanks to his natural charm and charisma. However, it is during the scenes where the humour becomes the main focus that the film falls flat. The silliest moments of the film come during a sequence where Bond is being chased through the jungle. In the space of several minutes Bond attempts to calm a tiger by telling it to \u0080\u009csit\u0080\u009d in the style of famous dog trainer Barbara Woodhouse, he tells a snake to \u0080\u009chiss off\u0080\u009d and swings through the trees mimicking Tarzan\u0080\u0099s famous cry.

The original castle on     the site was built in the years that followed for the Stewarts of Menteith. As     originally constructed, the castle was protected by a steep slope descending on     its seaward side, and a water filled ditch on its landward side. The castle     itself comprised a tower which became the east end of the later building, with     a wall of enclosure to its west containing a series of domestic buildings     including a kitchen, stables and a chapel. [PAR] During the Wars of Independence, Brodick Castle was held by the     English until retaken by the Scots in 1307. Its subsequent history was equally     turbulent. English ships damaged the castle in 1406, and further damage was     caused in an attack by John MacDonald II, Lord of     the Isles in 1455.

[PAR] German poet and philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche is most famous for making the statement \"God is dead\" in the Nineteenth Century. Nietzsche, influenced by both Greek philosophy and the theory of evolution, wrote, \"God is dead. God remains dead. And we have killed him. How shall we, murderers of all murderers, console ourselves? . . . Is not the greatness of this deed too great for us? Must we not ourselves become gods simply to be worthy of it?\" (Nietzsche, The Gay Science, \u00a7125).

Opening track \"High\" sets a determined midtempo pace that rarely wanes -- it's like an acoustic version of \"Drive\" by the Cars with a Coldplay chorus. It's a pace that would sink some records, but Bedlam 's perfectly rendered, under 40-minute run time ensures that the listener doesn't suffer from a melancholy overdose. Blunt recounts his harrowing experiences as part of the NATO peacekeeping force in Kosovo on the closer, \"No Bravery,\" and it's a shock to hear all of the romantic lyricism that informed Bedlam up to this point reduced to \"Old men kneel and accept their fate/Wives and daughters cut and raped/A generation drenched in hate,\" but it's damn effective -- as is the majority of this fine debut.

Recorded in the Domesday book of 1086, it became a thriving market town in the Middle Ages, gaining its town charter from the King in 1207.

The earliest forms of the name Colchester are Colenceaster and Colneceastre from the 10th century, with the modern spelling of Colchester being found in the 15th century. In this way of interpreting the name, the River Colne which runs through the town takes its name from Colonia as well. Cologne (German K\u00f6ln) also gained its name from a similar etymology (from its Roman name Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium). [PAR] However, academic etymologists are confident that the Colne's name is of Celtic (pre-Roman) origin, sharing its origin with several other rivers Colne or Clun around Britain, and that Colchester is derived from Colne and Castra.  Ekwall went as far as to say \"it has often been held that Colchester contains as first element [Latin] colonia ... this derivation is ruled out of court by the fact that Colne is the name of several old villages situated a good many miles from Colchester and on the Colne.

They came in search of the legendary 'Seven Cities of Cibola', where the streets were, by all accounts, paved with gold. In 1858, the inhabitants of Colorado finally discovered gold here. The city of Denver grew up around the mining camps, which were soon filled with thousands of immigrants. Colorado was admitted into the Union in 1876, the centennial year of the US Declaration of Independence, hence its nickname as the Centennial State. [PAR] The skiing credentials of Colorado date back to 1912, when a ski jumping contest was first held in Hot Sulphur Springs. "

Pliny said that Topazos is a legendary island in the Red Sea and the mineral \"topaz\" was first mined there. Alternatively, the word topaz may be related to the Sanskrit word \u0924\u092a\u0938\u094d \"tapas\", meaning \"heat\" or \"fire\". [PAR] Historical usage [PAR] Nicols, the author of one of the first systematic treatises on minerals and gemstones, dedicated two chapters to the topic in 1652.  In the Middle Ages, the name topaz was used to refer to any yellow gemstone, but in modern times it denotes only the silicate described above. [PAR] Many modern English translations of the Bible, including the King James Version mention topaz.  However, because these translations as topaz all derive from the Septuagint translation topazi[os], which as mentioned above referred to a yellow stone that was not topaz, but probably chrysolite (chrysoberyl or peridot), it should be borne in mind that topaz is likely not meant here.

This enabled the manufacture of lenses that, for the first time, conformed to the actual shape of the eye. [PAR] It was not until 1887 that a German glassblower, F.E. Muller, produced the first eye covering to be seen through and tolerated.[8] In the next year, the German physiologist Adolf Eugen Fick constructed and fitted the first successful contact lens.

These lenses were made from heavy brown glass and were 18\u201321mm in diameter. Fick filled the empty space between cornea/callosity and glass with a dextrose solution.

To boil the water inside a samovar, the pipe is filled with solid fuel such as pine cones, charcoals and wood chips which are set on fire. A small tea pot is used to brew a tea concentrate.

            "context": "| Middle School Teacher | (Level 3) Educator Emeritus [PAR] Posted on [PAR] July 15, 2012 at 6:14 AM [PAR] It is speculated that when Shakespeare set Much Ado About Nothing in Messina, he was actually thinking of Venice, which was one of the most corrupt cities of his time period ( \"The Artificiality of Messinian Society,\" eNotes ). Venice was extremely wealthy as they had a monopoly over trade in China due to the success of the Venetian explorer, Marco Polo, who opened trade routes between Beijing and Europe. Due to the city's wealth, the city's wealthy families were constantly competing with each other for grander palaces and more power. The city's wealthy also ruled the government. Venice was called a republic, however, the Great Council ruled the city, which consisted of the wealthiest and most influential families of Venice. The Great Council selected all public officials, including the Senate body, who elected the Council of Ten. The Council of Ten where the highest administrators and made decisions for the city in secret ( \"Venice During the Renaissance\" ). Hence, since Venice was really a wealthy totalitarian city who passed itself off as a republic, we can see that Venice was extremely corrupt and embodied the theme of appearances vs. reality that dominates Shakespeare's play. [PAR] Dogberry actually expresses this theme very well when he lists his attributes, which are his position of power, his wealth, and his beauty, which we see in his lines: [PAR] I am a wise fellow; and which is more, an officer; and which is more, a householder, and which is more, as pretty a piece of flesh as any is in Messina, and one that knows the law, go to! and a rich fellow enough, go to!
