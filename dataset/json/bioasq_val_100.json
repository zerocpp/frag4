Some of these LADs are cell-type specific, while many others appear constitutively associated with the lamina. Constitutive LADs (cLADs) may contribute to a basal chromosome architecture. By comparison of mouse and human lamina interaction maps, we find that the sizes and genomic positions of cLADs are strongly conserved. Moreover, cLADs are depleted of synteny breakpoints, pointing to evolutionary selective pressure to keep cLADs intact. Paradoxically, the overall sequence conservation is low for cLADs. Instead, cLADs are universally characterized by long stretches of DNA of high A/T content. Cell-type specific LADs also tend to adhere to this \"A/T rule\" in embryonic stem cells, but not in differentiated cells. This suggests that the A/T rule represents a default positioning mechanism that is locally overruled during lineage commitment. Analysis of paralogs suggests that during evolution changes in A/T content have driven the relocation of genes to and from the nuclear lamina, in tight association with changes in expression level. </context>"

A mutation in the mPer2 gene leads to a gradual loss of circadian rhythmicity in mice kept in constant darkness (DD). Here we show that inactivation of the mCry2 gene in mPer2 mutant mice restores circadian rhythmicity and normal clock gene expression patterns. Thus, mCry2 can act as a nonallelic suppressor of mPer2, which points to direct or indirect interactions of PER2 and CRY2 proteins. In marked contrast, inactivation of mCry1 in mPer2 mutant mice does not restore circadian rhythmicity but instead results in complete behavioral arrhythmicity in DD, indicating different effects of mCry1 and mCry2 in the clock mechanism</context>\n<context>Cryptochrome 1 and 2 gene products act in the negative feedback loop and are indispensable for molecular core oscillator function, as evident from the arrhythmic wheel running behaviour and absence of cyclic clock gene expression in mCry1/mCry2 double mutant mice in constant darkness.</context>\n<context>, when mCry-deficient mice are housed in normal light-dark cycles, a single non-circadian peak in neuronal activity can be detected in SCN slices prepared two hours after the beginning of the day.

In mouse livers, AMPK activity and nuclear localization were rhythmic and inversely correlated with CRY1 nuclear protein abundance. Stimulation of AMPK destabilized cryptochromes and altered circadian rhythms, and mice in which the AMPK pathway was genetically disrupted showed alterations in peripheral clocks. Thus, phosphorylation by AMPK enables cryptochrome to transduce nutrient signals to circadian clocks in mammalian peripheral organs.</context>\n<context>Cytoplasmic hnRNP D levels displayed a pattern that was reciprocal to the mcry1 oscillation. Knockdown of hnRNP D stabilized mcry1 mRNA and resulted in enhancement of the oscillation amplitude and a slight delay of the phase.

Depletion of Usp2a by shRNA greatly enhances the ubiquitination of CRY1 and dampens the oscillation amplitude of the CRY1 protein during a circadian cycle. By stabilizing the CRY1 protein, USP2a represses the Per2 promoter activity as well as the endogenous Per2 gene expression.

Wapl is associated with cohesin throughout the cell cycle, and its depletion blocks cohesin dissociation from chromosomes during the early stages of mitosis and prevents the resolution of sister chromatids until anaphase, which occurs after a delay. Wapl depletion also increases the residence time of cohesin on chromatin in interphase.

Modelling of identified mutations showed that they inactivate the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of HUWE1. Genetic deletion of Huwe1 rapidly accelerated tumourigenic in mice carrying loss of the intestinal tumour suppressor gene Apc, with a dramatic increase in tumour initiation. Mechanistically, this phenotype was driven by increased MYC and rapid DNA damage accumulation leading to loss of the second copy of Apc The increased levels of DNA damage sensitised Huwe1-deficient tumours to DNA-damaging agents and to deletion of the anti-apoptotic protein MCL1. Taken together, these data identify HUWE1 as a bona fide tumour suppressor gene in the intestinal epithelium and suggest a potential vulnerability of HUWE1-mutated tumours to DNA-damaging agents and inhibitors of anti-apoptotic proteins.</context>"

AZD5153 is a novel BRD4 inhibitor.METHODS: Prostate cancer cells were treated with AZD5153. Cell survival was tested by MTT assay and clonogenicity assay. Cell proliferation was tested by [H3] DNA incorporation assay. Cell apoptosis was tested by caspase-3/-9 activity assay, Histone DNA ELISA assay, Annexin V FACS assay and TUNEL staining assay. Cell cycle progression was tested by propidium iodide (PI) FACS assay. Signaling was tested by Western blotting assay. The nude mice PC-3 xenograft model was applied to test AZD5153's activity in vivo.RESULTS: AZD5153 inhibited proliferation and survival of established and primary prostate cancer cells. AZD5153 induced apoptosis activation and cell cycle arrest in prostate cancer cells. AZD5153 was non-cytotoxic to the prostate epithelial cells. AZD5153 downregulated BRD4 targets (cyclin D1, Myc, Bcl-2, FOSL1 and CDK4) in PC-3 and primary prostate cancer cells. Further studies show that AKT could be the primary resistance factor of AZD5153. Pharmacological inhibition or genetic depletion of AKT induced BRD4 downregulation, sensitizing AZD5153-induced cytotoxicity in PC-3 cells. In vivo, AZD5153 oral administration inhibited PC-3 xenograft tumor growth in nude mice. Its anti-tumor activity was further enhanced with co-treatment of the AKT specific inhibitor MK-2206.CONCLUSION: Together, our results indicate a promising therapeutic value of the novel BRD4 inhibitor AZD5153 against prostate cancer cells.</context>\n<context>AZD5153 induced apoptosis activation and cell cycle arrest in prostate cancer cells.</context>\n<context>CONCLUSION\n\nTogether, our results indicate a promising therapeutic value of the novel BRD4 inhibitor AZD5153 against prostate cancer cells.</context>\n<context>AZD5153 downregulated BRD4 targets (cyclin D1, Myc, Bcl-2, FOSL1 and CDK4) in PC-3 and primary prostate cancer cells.</context>\n<context>RESULTS\n\nAZD5153 inhibited proliferation and survival of established and primary prostate cancer cells.</context>\n<context>RESULTS AZD5153 inhibited proliferation and survival of established and primary prostate cancer cells.</context>\n<context>AZD5153 induced apoptosis activation and cell cycle arrest in prostate cancer cells.</context>\n<context>AZD5153 downregulated BRD4 targets (cyclin D1, Myc, Bcl-2, FOSL1 and CDK4) in PC-3 and primary prostate cancer cells.</context>\n<context>CONCLUSION Together, our results indicate a promising therapeutic value of the novel BRD4 inhibitor AZD5153 against prostate cancer cells.</context>\n<context>AZD5153 Inhibits Prostate Cancer Cell Growth in Vitro and in Vivo</context>\n<context>AZD5153 induced apoptosis activation and cell cycle arrest in prostate cancer cells.</context>"

Eighty-seven percent of the introns assayed manifest >50% cotranscriptional splicing. The remaining 13% are cotranscriptionally spliced poorly or slowly, with \u223c3% being almost completely retained in nascent pre-mRNA.</context>\n<context>We estimate that > or =90% of endogenous yeast splicing is posttranscriptional, consistent with an analysis of posttranscriptional snRNP-associated pre-mRNA.</context>\n<context>Notably, the topoisomerase I inhibitor camptothecin, which stalls elongating Pol II, increased cotranscriptional splicing factor accumulation and splicing in parallel. This provides direct evidence for a kinetic link between transcription, splicing factor recruitment and splicing catalysis.</context>\n<context>Recent evidence indicates that transcriptional elongation and splicing can be influenced reciprocally: Elongation rates control alternative splicing and splicing factors can, in turn, modulate pol II elongation.</context>\n<context>The presence of transcription factors in the spliceosome and the existence of proteins, such as the coactivator PGC-1, with dual activities in splicing and transcription can explain the links between both processes and add a new level of complexity to the regulation of gene expression in eukaryotes.</context>"
