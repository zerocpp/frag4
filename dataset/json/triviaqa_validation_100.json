            "context": "Georges Braque\u2019s 1908 Houses at L\u2019Estaque (and related works) prompted the critic Louis Vauxcelles to refer to bizarreries cubiques (cubic oddities). Gertrude Stein referred to landscapes made by Picasso in 1909, such as Reservoir at Horta de Ebro, as the first Cubist paintings. The first organized group exhibition by Cubists took place at the Salon des Ind\u00e9pendants in Paris during the spring of 1911 in a room called \u2018Salle 41\u2019; it included works by Jean Metzinger, Albert Gleizes, Fernand L\u00e9ger, Robert Delaunay and Henri Le Fauconnier, yet no works by Picasso and Braque were exhibited. [PAR] By 1911 Picasso was recognized as the inventor of Cubism, while Braque\u2019s importance and precedence was argued later, with respect to his treatment of space, volume and mass in the L\u2019Estaque landscapes. But \u201cthis view of Cubism is associated with a distinctly restrictive definition of which artists are properly to be called Cubists,\u201d wrote the art historian Christopher Green: \u201cMarginalizing the contribution of the artists who exhibited at the Salon des Ind\u00e9pendants in 1911. [PAR] Pablo Picasso, Les Demoiselles d\u2019Avignon, 1907, considered to be a major step towards the founding of the Cubist movement. [PAR] Historians have divided the history of Cubism into phases. In one scheme, the first phase of Cubism, known as Analytic Cubism, a phrase coined by Juan Gris a posteriori, was both radical and influential as a short but highly significant art movement between 1910 and 1912 in France. A second phase, Synthetic Cubism, remained vital until around 1919, when the Surrealist movement gained popularity. English art historian Douglas Cooper proposed another scheme, describing three phases of Cubism in his book, The Cubist Epoch. According to Cooper there was \u201cEarly ",

Her albums were loose and eclectic on the surface, yet were generally tied together by polished, professional songcraft. Crow's sunny, good-time rockers and world-weary ballads were radio staples for much of the '90s, and she was a perennial favorite at Grammy time. Although her songwriting style was firmly anchored to the rock tradition, she wasn't a slave to it -- her free-associative, reference-laden poetry could hardly have been the product of any era but the '90s. Her production not only kept pace with contemporary trends, but sometimes even pushed the envelope of what sounds could be heard on a classicist rock album, especially on her self-titled sophomore effort. All of this made Crow one of the most dependable stars of the decade, and she showed no signs of relinquishing her hard-won success in the new millennium.

This caused an immediate rift between the provinces of Holland and Zealand as De With was the personal enemy of the commander of the Zealandic fleet, Vice-Admiral Johan Evertsen, who himself had quit service because of a conflict with the States-General.

The architect Stanford White designed the Wardenclyffe facility main building. Funding for Tesla's project was provided by influential industrialists and other venture capitalists . The project was also initially backed by the wealthy J. P. Morgan (he had a substantial investment in the facility, initially investing a sum in the range of $100,000 to $150,000). [PAR] In June 1902 , Tesla moved his laboratory operations from his Houston Street laboratory to Wardenclyffe. However, in 1903 , when the tower structure was near completion, it was still not yet functional due to a design error. When Morgan wanted to know \"Where can I put the meter?\", Tesla had no answer. Tesla's vision of free power did not agree with Morgan's worldview. Construction costs eventually exceeded the money provided by Morgan, and additional financiers were reluctant to come forth. By July 1904 , Morgan (and the other investors) finally decided they would not provide any additional financing. Morgan also encouraged other investors to avoid the project. In May 1905 , Tesla's patents on alternating current motors and other methods of power transmission expired, halting royalty payments and causing a severe reduction of funding to the Wardenclyffe Tower. In an attempt to find alternative funding, Tesla advertised the services of the Wardenclyffe facility, but he met with little success. ",

The first written mention of Japan is in Chinese history texts from the 1st century CE. Influence from other regions, mainly Imperial China, followed by periods of isolation, particularly from Western Europe, has characterized Japan's history. From the 12th century until 1868, Japan was ruled by successive feudal military shoguns who ruled in the name of the Emperor. Japan entered into a long period of isolation in the early 17th century, which was ended in 1853 when a United States fleet pressured Japan to open to the West. Nearly two decades of internal conflict and insurrection followed before the Meiji Emperor was restored as head of state in 1868 and the Empire of Japan was proclaimed, with the Emperor as a divine symbol of the nation. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, victories in the First Sino-Japanese War, the Russo-Japanese War and World War I allowed Japan to expand its empire during a period of increasing militarism. The Second Sino-Japanese War of 1937 expanded into part of World War II in 1941, which came to an end in 1945 following the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

The play is a favourite for study by English literature and theatre classes in Britain and the United States. It is one of the few plays from the 18th century to have an enduring appeal, and is still regularly performed today. It has been adapted into a film several times, including in 1914 and 1923. Initially the play was titled Mistakes of a Night, and indeed, the events within the play take place in one long night. In 1778 John O'Keeffe wrote a loose sequel, Tony Lumpkin in Town.   Productions   The original production opened in London at Covent Garden Theatre on 15 March 1773 and was an immediate success. Lionel Brough is supposed to have played Tony Lumpkin 777 times. Lillie Langtry had her first big success in this play in 1881.   Perhaps one of the most famous modern incarnations of She Stoops to Conquer was Peter Hall's version, staged in 1993 and starring Miriam Margolyes as Mrs. Hardcastle. "

The study of interactions has led to a  number of conservation laws which govern them. These conservation laws are in addition to the classical conservation laws such as conservation of energy, charge, etc., which still apply in the realm of particle interactions. Strong overall conservation laws are the conservation of baryon number and the conservation of lepton number . Specific quantum numbers have been assigned to the different fundamental particles, and other conservation laws are associated with those quantum numbers. [PAR] From another point of view, it would seem that any localized particle of finite mass should be unstable, since the decay into several smaller particles provides many more ways to distribute the energy, and thus would have higher entropy . This idea is even stated as a principle called the \" totalitarian principle \" which might be stated as \"every process that is not forbidden must occur\". From this point of view, any decay process which is expected but not observed must be prevented from occuring by some conservation law. This approach has been fruitful in helping to determine the rules for particle decay. [PAR] Conservation laws for parity , isospin , and strangeness have been developed by detailed observation of particle interactions. ",

            "context": "A pressure casement is needed to contain the working fluid as it acts on the turbine stage(s) or the turbine must be fully immersed in the fluid flow (such as with wind turbines). The casing contains and directs the working fluid and, for water turbines, maintains the suction imparted by the draft tube. Francis turbines and most steam turbines use this concept. For compressible working fluids, multiple turbine stages are usually used to harness the expanding gas efficiently. Newton's third law describes the transfer of energy for reaction turbines. [PAR] In the case of steam turbines, such as would be used for marine applications or for land-based electricity generation, a Parsons type reaction turbine would require approximately double the number of blade rows as a de Laval type impulse turbine, for the same degree of thermal energy conversion. Whilst this makes the Parsons turbine much longer and heavier, the overall efficiency of a reaction turbine is slightly higher than the equivalent impulse turbine for the same thermal energy conversion. [PAR] In practice, modern turbine designs use both reaction and impulse concepts to varying degrees whenever possible. Wind turbines use an airfoil to generate a reaction lift from the moving fluid and impart it to the rotor. Wind turbines also gain some energy from the impulse of the wind, by deflecting it at an angle. Turbines with multiple stages may utilize either reaction or impulse blading at high pressure. Steam turbines were traditionally more impulse but continue to move towards reaction designs similar to those used in gas turbines.

The Principle is assumed but has never been demonstrated observationally beyond reasonable doubt. [PAR] To give some sense of scale, whole clusters of galaxies can be 2-3 Megaparsecs across, but LQGs can be 200 Megaparsecs or more across. Based on the Cosmological Principle and the modern theory of cosmology, calculations suggest that scientists should not be able to find a structure larger than 370 Megaparsecs. [PAR] The Huge-LQG however has a typical dimension of 500 Megaparsecs. But because it is elongated, its longest dimension is 1200 Megaparsecs \u2013 some 1600 times larger than the distance from the Milky Way to Andromeda. [PAR] \u201cWhile it is difficult to fathom the scale of this LQG, we can say quite definitely it is the largest structure ever seen in the entire Universe. This is hugely exciting \u2013 not least because it runs counter to our current understanding of the scale of the Universe,\u201d said Dr Roger Clowes of the University of Central Lancashire Jeremiah Horrocks Institute, lead author of the study accepted for publication in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society ( arXiv.org version ). [PAR] \u201cEven travelling at the speed of light, it would take 4 billion light years to cross. This is significant not just because of its size but also because it challenges the Cosmological Principle, which has been widely accepted since Einstein. ",

All of these regional appellations allow a selection of grape varieties in their blends, including Cabernet Sauvignon , Chardonnay , Syrah and the native Bulgarian grape variety of Mavrud (known here as Mavroudi). [PAR] The town of Maronia on the Aegean coast is particularly important to the history of the region, as it was where Odysseus was given the 'honey-sweet' wine that he used to intoxicate the Cyclops before killing it in Homer's epic, 'The Odyssey'. Now, Maronia has become one of Thraki's most-important grape-growing areas. Vines on south-facing hills are protected from cold winds from the north while still enjoying refreshing breezes from the Aegean Sea. These breezes help to temper the hot sunshine of the region, slowing the ripening period and allowing grapes to develop flavor without losing acidity . The free-draining red soils retain enough water to keep vines hydrated during the dry summers. [PAR] Avdira, just south of the city of Xanthi, is another of Thraki's most viticulturally productive areas, and has a similarly Mediterranean climate to Maronia, although there is a warmer mesoclimate due to the lower elevations of the vineyards.

But the visitors who take the time to cross the river to Eton find an attractive town dotted with fine historic buildings. [PAR] Eton College [PAR] The chief attraction is, of course, the famous public school, founded in 1440 by Henry VI. The original name of the school was \"The King\u2019s College of Our Lady of Eton beside Windsor\", and it was meant to provide scholars for King's College, Cambridge, which Henry established in the following year. The original student body was made up of 70 poor students who lived at the school, and were educated for free, and several paying students who lived in the town itself. To fund the school Henry gave it several holy relics and, perhaps more practically, large grants of land. [PAR] The extensive building that Henry envisaged for Eton chapel would have made it one of the largest and finest in the country, but when Henry was ousted by Edward IV Eton suffered the loss of much of its property, and building on the church ceased. Bishop Waynflete came to the rescue, however, and provided funds to finish the choir and add the antechapel. ",

The Director was so successful that a second edition appeared in 1755 and a third edition, revised and enlarged, in 1762. [PAR] One of Chippendale's important early commissions was the furnishing of Dumfries House in Scotland in 1759.

Both were members of  the Society of Arts, to which Chippendale was elected in 1760. [PAR] The Director was the principal inspiration behind the characteristic mahogany furniture of the mid-18th century, and Chippendale's designs were used, often in greatly simplified form, by innumerable provincial and rural craftsmen. The most distinguished furniture produced from the Chippendale workshops, however, was the handsome marquetry pieces inspired by the neoclassic designs of Robert Adam. It was for many years hotly debated whether Chippendale ever actually made furniture to the architect's designs, but that he did so is conclusively proved by Chippendale's bill of July 9, 1765, for the supply to Sir Lawrence Dundas of armchairs and sofas which correspond exactly to an Adam design dated 1765.

Napoleon rose through the ranks of the French army during the French Revolution (1789-1799), seized control of the French government in 1799 and became emperor in 1804. Through a series of wars, he expanded his empire across western and central Europe. However, a disastrous invasion of Russia in 1812, coupled with other defeats, led to his abdication and exile in 1814. He returned to France in 1815 and briefly resumed power.

[PAR] Lee\u2019s body was returned to Seattle, where he was buried. His sudden death at the young age of 32 led to rumors and speculation about the cause of his demise. One theory held that Lee had been murdered by Chinese gangsters, while another rumor circulated that the actor had been the victim of a curse. The family-curse theory resurfaced when Lee\u2019s 28-year-old son Brandon, who had followed in his father\u2019s footsteps to become an actor, died in an accidental shooting on the set of the movie The Crow on March 31, 1993. The younger Lee was buried next to his father at Seattle\u2019s Lake View Cemetery. "
