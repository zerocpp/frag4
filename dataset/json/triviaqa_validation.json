Gertrude Stein referred to landscapes made by Picasso in 1909, such as Reservoir at Horta de Ebro, as the first Cubist paintings. The first organized group exhibition by Cubists took place at the Salon des Ind\u00e9pendants in Paris during the spring of 1911 in a room called \u2018Salle 41\u2019; it included works by Jean Metzinger, Albert Gleizes, Fernand L\u00e9ger, Robert Delaunay and Henri Le Fauconnier, yet no works by Picasso and Braque were exhibited.

In one scheme, the first phase of Cubism, known as Analytic Cubism, a phrase coined by Juan Gris a posteriori, was both radical and influential as a short but highly significant art movement between 1910 and 1912 in France. A second phase, Synthetic Cubism, remained vital until around 1919, when the Surrealist movement gained popularity.

Earlier tensions had been moderated by the fact that both Tromp and Evertsen were staunch Orangists, but De With was a loyal servant of the States regime that had dominated Dutch politics since the death of stadtholder William II of Orange.De With, having for months advocated a more aggressive naval policy aimed at destroying the enemy fleet instead of passively defending the merchant convoys against English attack, now saw an opportunity to concentrate his forces, joining the squadron of Vice-Commodore Michiel de Ruyter, and gain control of the seas. He set out to attack the English fleet at anchor at The Downs near Dover, departing from the Schooneveld on 5 October 1652; immediately the fleet was hit by a storm damaging many vessels. De With also had to protect the trade routes and discovered that nine of De Ruyter's ships, that had been on sea for two months, had to return to port "

The architect Stanford White designed the Wardenclyffe facility main building. Funding for Tesla's project was provided by influential industrialists and other venture capitalists . The project was also initially backed by the wealthy J. P. Morgan (he had a substantial investment in the facility, initially investing a sum in the range of $100,000 to $150,000). [PAR] In June 1902 , Tesla moved his laboratory operations from his Houston Street laboratory to Wardenclyffe. However, in 1903 , when the tower structure was near completion, it was still not yet functional due to a design error. When Morgan wanted to know \"Where can I put the meter?\", Tesla had no answer. Tesla's vision of free power did not agree with Morgan's worldview. Construction costs eventually exceeded the money provided by Morgan, and additional financiers were reluctant to come forth. By July 1904 , Morgan (and the other investors) finally decided they would not provide any additional financing. Morgan also encouraged other investors to avoid the project. In May 1905 , Tesla's patents on alternating current motors and other methods of power transmission expired, halting royalty payments and causing a severe reduction of funding to the Wardenclyffe Tower. In an attempt to find alternative funding, Tesla advertised the services of the Wardenclyffe facility, but he met with little success. ",

The first written mention of Japan is in Chinese history texts from the 1st century CE. Influence from other regions, mainly Imperial China, followed by periods of isolation, particularly from Western Europe, has characterized Japan's history. From the 12th century until 1868, Japan was ruled by successive feudal military shoguns who ruled in the name of the Emperor. Japan entered into a long period of isolation in the early 17th century, which was ended in 1853 when a United States fleet pressured Japan to open to the West. Nearly two decades of internal conflict and insurrection followed before the Meiji Emperor was restored as head of state in 1868 and the Empire of Japan was proclaimed, with the Emperor as a divine symbol of the nation. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, victories in the First Sino-Japanese War, the Russo-Japanese War and World War I allowed Japan to expand its empire during a period of increasing militarism. The Second Sino-Japanese War of 1937 expanded into part of World War II in 1941, which came to an end in 1945 following the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Since adopting its revised constitution in 1947, Japan has maintained a unitary constitutional monarchy with an Emperor and an elected legislature called the National Diet.

With the introduction of the Roman-style typeface in the late 1400\u2032s, the original large mark was reduced to the small dot we use today. [PAR] Many alphabets use a tittle specifically in the case of the letter i.

These conservation laws are in addition to the classical conservation laws such as conservation of energy, charge, etc., which still apply in the realm of particle interactions. Strong overall conservation laws are the conservation of baryon number and the conservation of lepton number . Specific quantum numbers have been assigned to the different fundamental particles, and other conservation laws are associated with those quantum numbers.

            "context": "A pressure casement is needed to contain the working fluid as it acts on the turbine stage(s) or the turbine must be fully immersed in the fluid flow (such as with wind turbines). The casing contains and directs the working fluid and, for water turbines, maintains the suction imparted by the draft tube. Francis turbines and most steam turbines use this concept. For compressible working fluids, multiple turbine stages are usually used to harness the expanding gas efficiently. Newton's third law describes the transfer of energy for reaction turbines. [PAR] In the case of steam turbines, such as would be used for marine applications or for land-based electricity generation, a Parsons type reaction turbine would require approximately double the number of blade rows as a de Laval type impulse turbine, for the same degree of thermal energy conversion. Whilst this makes the Parsons turbine much longer and heavier, the overall efficiency of a reaction turbine is slightly higher than the equivalent impulse turbine for the same thermal energy conversion. [PAR] In practice, modern turbine designs use both reaction and impulse concepts to varying degrees whenever possible. Wind turbines use an airfoil to generate a reaction lift from the moving fluid and impart it to the rotor. Wind turbines also gain some energy from the impulse of the wind, by deflecting it at an angle. Turbines with multiple stages may utilize either reaction or impulse blading at high pressure. Steam turbines were traditionally more impulse but continue to move towards reaction designs similar to those used in gas turbines. At low pressure the operating fluid medium expands in volume for small reductions in ",

It was in the following year when Hans Riegel came up with the idea that would become HARIBO's flagship product: the \"Dancing Bear.\" Made of fruit gum, the \"Dancing Bear\" soon became extremely popular. So popular that the couple had to buy a car in the following year to deliver them to HARIBO's rapidly growing customer base. After moving into a small factory in Bonn-Kessenich, HARIBO started making licorice products in addition to hard candy and fruit gums. By 1930, the company already employed 160 people and HARIBO products were distributed throughout Germany. The company invested in a brand new production plant which was built between 1930 and 1933. In the early 1930s, the company founder hired a traveling advertising copy writer to create a memorable slogan. He came up with \"HARIBO macht Kinder froh\" a rhyme meaning \"HARIBO makes children happy,\" which was soon printed on posters for shopping windows, delivery trucks, cartons, and packages. [PAR] Based on business contacts between Riegel and the Hansen brothers, the owners of the Danish candy manufacturer Sukkervarenfabrikker Danmark, in the late 1920s, HARIBO's first joint venture abroad was set up in Denmark in 1935. By 1939, HARIBO had grown into a middle sized firm, employing about 400 people producing about ten tons of candy a day. However, that year World War II broke out. Since candy products were not essential for the German war economy, it became more and more difficult for the company to get the raw materials needed. Consequently"

Plant leaves, especially rhubarb,   cabbage, spinach, and beet tops, contain oxalic acid. Oxalic acid is also found in potatoes and peas.

All of these regional appellations allow a selection of grape varieties in their blends, including Cabernet Sauvignon , Chardonnay , Syrah and the native Bulgarian grape variety of Mavrud (known here as Mavroudi). [PAR] The town of Maronia on the Aegean coast is particularly important to the history of the region, as it was where Odysseus was given the 'honey-sweet' wine that he used to intoxicate the Cyclops before killing it in Homer's epic, 'The Odyssey'. Now, Maronia has become one of Thraki's most-important grape-growing areas. Vines on south-facing hills are protected from cold winds from the north while still enjoying refreshing breezes from the Aegean Sea. These breezes help to temper the hot sunshine of the region, slowing the ripening period and allowing grapes to develop flavor without losing acidity . The free-draining red soils retain enough water to keep vines hydrated during the dry summers. [PAR] Avdira, just south of the city of Xanthi, is another of Thraki's most viticulturally productive areas, and has a similarly Mediterranean climate to Maronia, although there is a warmer mesoclimate due to the lower elevations of the vineyards.

The Director was so successful that a second edition appeared in 1755 and a third edition, revised and enlarged, in 1762. [PAR] One of Chippendale's important early commissions was the furnishing of Dumfries House in Scotland in 1759.

Both were members of  the Society of Arts, to which Chippendale was elected in 1760. [PAR] The Director was the principal inspiration behind the characteristic mahogany furniture of the mid-18th century, and Chippendale's designs were used, often in greatly simplified form, by innumerable provincial and rural craftsmen. The most distinguished furniture produced from the Chippendale workshops, however, was the handsome marquetry pieces inspired by the neoclassic designs of Robert Adam. It was for many years hotly debated whether Chippendale ever actually made furniture to the architect's designs, but that he did so is conclusively proved by Chippendale's bill of July 9, 1765, for the supply to Sir Lawrence Dundas of armchairs and sofas which correspond exactly to an Adam design dated 1765.

The first ten were spent fighting in the Trojan War, and the next ten were spent in continual wanderings en route home from the war. His wife Penelope, meanwhile, has been harassed by dozens of suitors who have come to win her hand in marriage. Penelope, desperately clinging to the hope that her husband is still alive, tries to stall the suitors by making them an idle promise: she will choose a husband from among them when she has finished weaving a burial shroud for her father-in-law, Laertes, who presently lives on a farm removed from the main city. However, when alone at night, Penelope secretly undoes the work of the shroud so that the fabrication of the garment will go on indefinitely. Unfortunately, the ruse has been discovered by the suitors, who now demand she choose one of them immediately. [PAR] The suitors, who have been awaiting her decision for several years, have in the meantime spent their days feasting in Odysseus\u2019 hall. In so doing, they are devouring his livestock and abusing his servants. The direct victim of their voracious behavior is Tele-machus, the son of Odysseus who is now approaching manhood. Telemachus, who is the heir of Odysseus\u2019 property and title, is constantly derided and taunted by the suitors who waste his father\u2019s household. "

[PAR] The sexual form begins with male and female eggs laid on the underside of young grape leaves. The male and female at this stage lack a digestive system, and once hatched, they mate and then die. Before the female dies, she lays one winter egg in the bark of the vine's trunk. This egg develops into the leaf form. This nymph, the fundatrix (stem mother), climbs onto a leaf and lays eggs (via parthenogenesis ) into a leaf gall she creates by injecting saliva into the leaf. The nymphs that hatch from these eggs may move to other leaves, or move to the roots where they begin new infections in the root form. In this form they perforate the root to find nourishment, infecting the root with a poisonous secretion that prevents it from healing. It is this poison which eventually kills the vine. "

Saliva also makes the food easier to swallow. [PAR] The Digestive Tract: Several organs make up a bird's digestive tract. From the bill, food moves down a tube called the esophagus and into the crop , which stores excess food so the bird can digest it slowly. The food then moves to the proventriculous, the first part of the stomach, where it is softened by gastric acid, mucus and other digestive juices. The second part of the stomach, the gizzard , grinds the food into smaller pieces, often with the aid of grit such as sand or small stones the bird has swallowed earlier. If the food is particularly tough, it may move between the proventriculous and the gizzard several times for more efficient digestion. Once the food is sufficiently broken down, it moves into the small intestine, where the liver and pancreas help with absorbing nutrients. Next is the large intestine, which is very short for most birds. Where the small and large intestines join are the ceca, two pouches that help absorb any remaining water from the food and finish the digestive process.

Their name comes from their ship, the Argo, which was named after its builder, Argus. \"Argonauts\", therefore, literally means \"Argo sailors\". They were sometimes called Minyans, after a prehistoric tribe of the area. Jason was accompanied by some of the principal heroes of ancient Greece. The number of Argonauts varies, but usually totals between 40 and 55; traditional versions of the story place their number at 50.

This had eight sides, curved to give a slender waisted shape, which were covered by horizontal weather-boards.

The battle was named for the panicked retreat by Major Isaiah Stillman and his detachment of 275 Illinois militia after being attacked by many fewer Sauk warriors of Black Hawk's British Band. The engagement was the first battle of the Black Hawk War (1832), which developed after Black Hawk crossed the Mississippi River from Iowa into Illinois with his band of Sauk and Fox warriors to try to reclaim territory. The militia had pursued a small group of Sauk scouts to the main British Band camp following a failed attempt by Black Hawk's emissaries to negotiate a truce. [PAR] During the engagement, 12 militia men were killed by Band warriors while making a stand on a small hill. The remainder of the militia fled back to Dixon's Ferry. Citizens erected a monument in 1901 in Stillman Valley, Illinois commemorating the battle.

[PAR] Henry was born in Lancashire in April 1367. His parents were cousins, his father John of Gaunt, third surviving son of Edward III, his mother descended from Henry III. In 1377 Henry's cousin, Richard II became king. In 1386, Henry joined a group of opposition leaders - the lords appellants - who outlawed Richard's closest associates and forced the king to accept their counsel. In 1398, Richard took revenge, banishing Henry after he quarrelled with another member of the court. The following year, John of Gaunt died. Richard seized the family estates, depriving Henry of his inheritance and prompting him to invade England. He met little opposition, as many were horrified by the king's actions. Richard surrendered in August and Henry was crowned in October 1399, claiming that Richard had abdicated of his own free will. [PAR] Henry's first task was to consolidate his position. Most rebellions were quashed easily, but the revolt of the Welsh squire Owen Glendower in 1400 was more serious. "

But in 1955, no one was talking about the rock pantheon. Bill Haley & His Comets had no rivals.

[PAR] During the case, Redknapp admitted he \u2018wrote like a two-year old\u2019, and said he was too disorganised to know how to fiddle his taxes. [PAR] A Tottenham spokesman said: \u2018Everyone at the club is delighted for Harry and his family.

The rock was the scene of many shipwrecks as it lies just below the surface of the sea for all but a few hours at low tide.

In one storm alone, seventy ships were lost off the east coast of Scotland.  The Scottish engineer Robert Stevenson had  proposed the construction of a lighthouse on Bell Rock in 1799, but cost concerns and the relatively radical nature of the proposal by a young engineer caused it to be shelved. The loss of the warship  and all on board in 1804 resulted in a furore in Parliament. Stevenson sent his design to John Rennie who approved the design and costing. Rennie's reputation led to legislation being passed in 1806 enabling construction to begin.  [PAR] The Northern Lighthouse Board awarded the contract to design and build to John Rennie, with Stevenson being appointed as chief assistant.  The design was based on the earlier Eddystone Lighthouse designed by John Smeaton, which Stevenson had inspected in 1801, and which was also built on an offshore reef using interlocking stones. ",

They believe that the ancient Scandinavians dedicated their Yule festival to the god Thor, whose companion animal was the goat. According to legend, this Norse god rode in a chariot pulled by two billy goats. Others view the Yule goat as a medieval invention. They argue that the goat typically accompanied the Devil in medieval folk plays performed around Christmas time. [PAR] In medieval times the Yule goat frolicked at the center of Scandinavian Christmas festivities. Using a goat skin and head as a costume, two men would masquerade as a goat, sometimes with a third sitting astride them. Such displays and the raucous revelry that accompanied them alarmed Church authorities. In the sixteenth century they began to issue prohibitions against these kinds of events. Nevertheless, groups of young people in Sweden maintained the goat as a sort of mascot when they caroled and danced for their neighbors around Christmas time. In the eighteenth century the goat adopted a new Christmas role in Sweden: gift bringer. ",

Such readings ground their admiring assessments of Ishmael in Western humanist values, both secular and Christian, that fundamentally emphasize the freedom of the self, the triumphant historical progress of human knowledge, and the optimistic image of an ethical humanity.

When it was launched, it was available only with a 2.5-litre V6 petrol engine (which incidentally gave it a refined feel that led several journalists to consider it at the time as an inexpensive alternative to a proper luxury car), but this has since been deleted on the grounds that absolutely nobody wanted it. A two-litre petrol engine also came and went, and now the only power source you can have is the rather splendid 148bhp two-litre turbo diesel also fitted to several other Kias. [PAR] This engine is probably the best thing about the Magentis, which in most other respects is a reminder of the days when the main reason for buying any Kia was that it didn't involve spending much money.

In the Opium Wars of 1839-1842 and 1856-1860, the British forced the Chinese to accept the import of opium in return for Chinese goods, and trading centres were established at major ports. The largest of these was Shanghai, where French, German, British, and American merchants demanded large tracts of land in which they asserted \"extra-territorial\" rights - being subject to the laws of their own country rather than Chinese law. According to popular myth, a sign at Huangpu\u00a0Park near a European compound read: \"No dogs or Chinamen\".

During the civil war of 69 AD, Agricola supported Vespasian in his successful attempt to become emperor. Agricola was appointed to command a Roman legion in Britain.

The election of the Nationalist government in 1948, which instituted apartheid, and South Africa's withdrawal from the Commonwealth in 1961, ended any prospect of incorporation of the territories into South Africa. An expansion of British central authority and the evolution of tribal government resulted in the 1920 establishment of two advisory councils to represent both Africans and Europeans.

            "context": "[PAR] \u00a0 [PAR] Dutch Lieutenant-Admiral Maarten Tromp had been suspended by the States-General of the Netherlands after his failure to bring the English to battle off the Shetland Islands in August, and replaced as supreme commander of the confederate Dutch fleet by the Hollandic Vice-Admiral Witte de With of the Admiralty of the Maze. This caused an immediate rift between the provinces of Holland and Zealand as De With was the personal enemy of the commander of the Zealandic fleet, Vice-Admiral Johan Evertsen, who himself had quit service because of a conflict with the States-General. Earlier tensions had been moderated by the fact that both Tromp and Evertsen were staunch Orangists, but De With was a loyal servant of the States regime that had dominated Dutch politics since the death of stadtholder William II of Orange.De With, having for months advocated a more aggressive naval policy aimed at destroying the enemy fleet instead of passively defending the merchant convoys against English attack, now saw an opportunity to concentrate his forces, joining the squadron of Vice-Commodore Michiel de Ruyter, and gain control of the seas. He set out to attack the English fleet at anchor at The Downs near Dover, departing from the Schooneveld on 5 October 1652; immediately the fleet was hit by a storm damaging many vessels. De With also had to protect the trade routes and discovered that nine of De Ruyter's ships, that had been on sea for two months, had to return to port ",

One beetle consumes  approximately 40 cm2 of potato leaves at a larval stage, and up to additional  9.65 cm2 of foliage per day as an adult (Ferro et al., 1985). In addition to  impressive feeding rates, Colorado potato beetle is also characterized by high  fecundity, with one female laying 300-800 eggs (Harcourt, 1971). Furthermore,  the beetle has a remarkable ability to develop resistance to virtually every  chemical that has ever been used against it.

Not only does most of the novel's action unfold inside or around the cathedral, but from the top of its towers, Claude Frollo and Quasimodo can spy on virtually anyone in the entire city.

[PAR] HOW BOTULINUM TOXIN WORKS [PAR] Botox is very lethal and a small amount of the substance is enough to cause harm to humans. Botulinum toxin is made up of just two ordinary proteins joined together by easily broken chemical bonds\u2014sulfur-to-sulfur bonds between cysteine amino acids in two proteins (Ingraham, p.234). The heavier protein is responsible for seeking and finding the exact spot where nerves contact muscles. When botulinum toxin arrives at this critical junction, a lighter protein that is a protein-destroying enzyme called protease attacks the neuromuscular junction. Consequently, when the neuromuscular junction is destroyed, the neurotransmitter acetylcholine cannot bind to it. Botox works by neuromuscular inhibition of acetylcholine. Without the intervention of acetylcholine, muscle contraction and wrinkles will take place.

            "context": "At first it was a song on their 1967 album Days of Future Passed, the first to feature new members Justin Hayward, who wrote the song, and John Lodge. The melody of this ballad, as has been noted elsewhere, is close to the one used by Ben E. King on his 1963 melodramatic soul hit \"I (Who Have Nothing).\" That melody itself had been based on an Italian song King had heard in Italy, with English lyrics by his producers Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller. Still, the instrumentation on the Moody Blues track is substantially different, particularly in the use of an eerie mellotron, an instrument of course that would be a staple of the group's most popular recordings. \"Nights in White Satin\" does effectively fulfill what was probably the purpose Hayward and his bandmates had in mind for it: a ghostly, haunting nocturnal ballad, with a lilting and memorable melody. The melodrama gets pushed to the fore (as does the resemblance to the chorus of \"I (Who Have Nothing)\") on the chorus, as the tempo becomes more emphatic and the group's background vocals become especially eerie, like voices in a windblown night. The instrumental break is also well done and in keeping with the hushed mood of the production, an echoed drumbeat leading into a lonely flute solo, the orchestration becoming more dense as the break progresses, building to a near-crescendo before leading into the final verse. It wasn't until 1972, though, that the song became a huge American hit, when it was pulled out for a single. ",

The second came after decades of general neglect, when David Lynch decided to use Orbison's song \"In Dreams\" for his groundbreaking film Blue Velvet. Hipsters championed Orbison's music after seeing the film, and the last few years of his life were happy, productive ones as a result of his newly-rediscovered success. Then came the years following his death, in which his hits were not only incorporated into more soundtracks, but some films were even named after them. [PAR] Pretty Woman. The 1990 film that made Julia Roberts a force to be reckoned with was originally a bleak drama called $3000. When Disney converted it into a feel-good romantic comedy, they figured the audience-friendly title of Orbison's classic (actually called \"Oh, Pretty Woman\") was a better fit. "

            "context": "[DOC] [TLE] Lightning rodA lightning rod (US, AUS) or lightning conductor (UK) is a metal rod or metallic object mounted on top of an elevated structure, such as a building, a ship, or even a tree, electrically bonded using a wire or electrical conductor to interface with ground or \"earth\" through an electrode, engineered to protect the structure in the event of lightning strike. If lightning hits the structure, it will preferentially strike the rod and be conducted to ground through the wire, instead of passing through the structure, where it could start a fire or cause electrocution. Lightning rods are also called finials, air terminals or strike termination devices. [PAR] In a lightning protection system, a lightning rod is a single component of the system. The lightning rod requires a connection to earth to perform its protective function. Lightning rods come in many different forms, including hollow, solid, pointed, rounded, flat strips or even bristle brush-like. The main attribute common to all lightning rods is that they are all made of conductive materials, such as copper and aluminum. Copper and its alloys are the most common materials used in lightning protection.  [PAR] History  [PAR] The principle of the lightning rod was first detailed by Benjamin Franklin in Pennsylvania in 1749,  who in the subsequent years developed his invention for household application (published in 1753) and further improvements towards a reliable system around 1760.

The 1983 film, directed by Brian DePalma and written by Oliver Stone , was a modest hit when first released.

Since then, tribal villages have been bombed and napalmed, and local leaders tortured, executed or dropped out of helicopters. The cleansing, or pacification, of native people in Irian paved the way for the largest transmigration scheme the world has ever seen, with four million new inhabitants in little over a decade.

I was a woman, Jewish, a widow, a damn good painter, thank you, and a little too independent.\" [PAR] Synopsis [PAR] An ambitious and important artist in New York City during Abstract Expressionism's heyday, Lee Krasner's own career often was compromised by her role as supportive wife to Jackson Pollock, arguably the most significant postwar American painter, as well as by the male-dominated art world. Krasner was intimately involved in the synthesis of abstract form and psychological content, which announced the advent of Abstract Expressionism. Her desire to revise her aesthetic or what she called \"breaks,\" led to her innovative Little Imageseries of the late 1940s, her bold collages of the 1950s, and, later, her large canvases, brilliant with color, of the 1960s. Krasner was \"rediscovered\" by feminist art historians during the 1970s and lived to see a greater recognition of her art and career, which continues to grow to this day. [PAR] Key Ideas [PAR] Krasner was a key transitional figure within abstraction, who connected early-twentieth-century art with the new ideas of postwar America. Inspired by artist Piet Mondrian's \"grid,\" Krasner helped devise the \"all-over\" technique, which in turn influenced Pollock's revolutionary \"drip paintings.\" [PAR] Krasner was remarkable for her artistic versatility and advanced skill, which, coupled with her intensive training in art theory, enabled her to revise her style and technique multiple times over the course of her career. Krasner purposefully initiated these \"breaks\" in order to distance herself from such artists as Mark Rothko and Barnett Newman, whose work she "

Using a goat skin and head as a costume, two men would masquerade as a goat, sometimes with a third sitting astride them. Such displays and the raucous revelry that accompanied them alarmed Church authorities. In the sixteenth century they began to issue prohibitions against these kinds of events.

It treasures loving-kindness, compassion, equanimity, clarity of mind,     and wisdom. Its hope is to alleviate suffering and to create healing and transformation     so that all beings may experience the highest peace (nirvana).

[PAR] Conductivity values in Siemens/meter can be converted to % IACS by multiplying the conductivity value by 1.7241 x10-6. When conductivity values are reported in microSiemens/centimeter, the conductivity value is multiplied by 172.41 to convert to the % IACS value. [PAR] Electrical conductivity is a very useful property since values are affected by such things as a substances chemical composition and the stress state of crystalline structures. Therefore, electrical conductivity information can be used for measuring the purity of water, sorting materials, checking for proper heat treatment of metals, and inspecting for heat damage in some materials. [PAR] Electrical Resistivity [PAR] Electrical resistivity is the reciprocal of conductivity. It is the is the opposition of a body or substance to the flow of electrical current through it, resulting in a change of electrical energy into heat, light, or other forms of energy. The amount of resistance depends on the type of material. Materials with low resistivity are good conductors of electricity and materials with high resistivity are good insulators. [PAR] The SI unit for electrical resistivity is the ohm meter. Resistivity values are more commonly reported in micro ohm centimeters units.

Several other competition forms of movement and shooting - such as ski archery, snowshoe Biathlon, running and shooting and mountain bike Biathlon - are also normally included in the general category of biathlon. The word competition is used in biathlon instead of race because it is not only a race but a combination of two different competitive activities. [PAR] The combination of two very contradictory disciplines, skiing and shooting, in the same competition confronts an athlete with a very demanding challenge. Cross-country racing requires intense, full out physical exertion over an extended period of time while shooting demands extremely fine control and stability. When athletes arrive at the shooting range, they have to shoot at a very small target, with a racing heartbeat and heaving chest because the clock is running even while they are shooting. Switching from high-powered cross-country skiing to exacting marksmanship requires strength and control. The objective is to ski at high speed, yet reserve enough energy to hit five targets at the rifle range as fast as possible. ",

[PAR] Verdi was born near Busseto to a provincial family of moderate means, and developed a musical education with the help of a local patron.  Verdi came to dominate the Italian opera scene after the era of Bellini, Donizetti and Rossini, whose works significantly influenced him, becoming one of the pre-eminent opera composers in history. [PAR] In his early operas Verdi demonstrated a sympathy with the Risorgimento movement which sought the unification of Italy. He also participated briefly as an elected politician. The chorus \"Va, pensiero\" from his early opera Nabucco (1842), and similar choruses in later operas, were much in the spirit of the unification movement, and the composer himself became esteemed as a representative of these ideals. An intensely private person, Verdi however did not seek to ingratiate himself with popular movements and as he became professionally successful was able to reduce his operatic workload and sought to establish himself as a landowner in his native region. He surprised the musical world by returning, after his success with the opera Aida (1871), with three late masterpieces: his Requiem (1874), and the operas Otello (1887) and Falstaff (1893). [P",

It  also causes significant damage to tomato and eggplant. One beetle consumes  approximately 40 cm2 of potato leaves at a larval stage, and up to additional  9.65 cm2 of foliage per day as an adult (Ferro et al., 1985). In addition to  impressive feeding rates, Colorado potato beetle is also characterized by high  fecundity, with one female laying 300-800 eggs (Harcourt, 1971). Furthermore,  the beetle has a remarkable ability to develop resistance to virtually every  chemical that has ever been used against it.

The latter group gave the band its name -- it's an album track on 1986's True Stories -- but Radiohead never sounded much like the Heads, nor did they take much from Bowie apart from their willingness to experiment. Instead, they spliced Floyd's spaciness with U2's messianic arena-rock heft, bridging the gap with guitar skronk borrowed from the '80s American underground. Jonny Greenwood's jagged, brutal interjections on \"Creep,\" the band's 1993 breakthrough hit, recalled the ugly noise of the Pixies and Nirvana, a sound that translated over the expanse of an ocean, but in the throes of the alternative rock explosion of the mid-'90s, Radiohead were the odd band out. America remained besotted with their homegrown sensations, so \"Creep\" was treated as a one-hit wonder, and at home in England, they were seen as dour art-rock students lacking the glamour of neo-glam sensations Suede, and deliberately dodging the beery singalongs of Oasis.

[PAR] Franz Joseph Haydn [PAR] The Austrian composer Franz Joseph Haydn (1732-1809) in his instrumental music, especially the symphonies and string quartets, essentially founded and brought to first mature realization the formal and structural principles of the classical style. [PAR] Joseph Haydn virtually created the classical formal structures of the string quartet and symphony, which were developed later by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Ludwig van Beethoven. He participated in the development of other forms of 18th-century instrumental music, in addition to composing prolifically in the fields of sacred music, opera, and song. Throughout a lifetime of experimentation he developed in the quartet and symphony a fully mature classical tonal idiom, characterized externally by the four-movement structure (allegro, slow movement, minuet and trio, and finale) of the majority of these works and internally by emphasis on thematic and motivic development within a balanced tonal framework. Haydn evolved a tonal language that exhibited a gradual growth toward contrapuntal complexity and a vast range of expression in comparison to the technical simplicity and expressive triviality of much mid-18th-century instrumental music of the style galant.

[PAR] Tonight sees the world premiere of the latest James Bond Film \u2018Skyfall\u2019. With this in mind we look back on James Bonds golfing career and imagine what gadgets he might be using if he were to play a again in a future film. [PAR] The iconic 1964 film \u2018Goldfinger\u2019 first associated Bond (played by Sean Connery at the time) with the game of golf, in the high stakes round against possibly the most renowned Bond villains \u2018Auric Goldfinger\u2019. It was in fact this role in Goldfinger that gave Sir Sean Connery the golfing bug. [PAR] In the novel the course is set on fictional \u2018Royal St Marks\u2019 which was based heavily on Royal St Georges (Host of The Open Championship a record 14 times). Fleming was actually a competent golfer with a handicap of 9 (which just so happened to be the same as Bond) and was a member at Royal St Georges for many years, and in fact lunched at the club the day before he died of a heart attack, aged 56 in August 1964.

This could be an epithet for a person who is going through spiritual cultivation. In hymnography St. George is called the \"cultivator of Christ\". [PAR] St. George as a horseman and dragonslayer is related to water and wells. And the deprivation of water in the summer months, especially if it doesn't rain during the winter, could be a source of great suffering in places like Greece, Asia Minor and the Middle East. The dragon who breathes flames from his mouth is keeping the water of the area hostage - as the tale says - and it will not allow it to flow unless the princess is sacrificed to the dragon. Therefore, St. George slays the dragon and saves the princess. [PAR] Some would argue that the princess in the icon merely depicts Empress Alexandra, the wife of Diocletian, who converted to Christianity upon witnessing the sufferings of St. George and was martyred with him. Her image in icons with St. George could have inspired the later symbolic imagery and the narrative of St. George slaying the dragon to save the princess. [PAR] The dragon also symbolizes the wicked serpent, the devil, as we read in Revelation 12:9. The battle against the dragon could indicate the spiritual battle against the devil and evil for the salvation of the soul. The fear of the dragon is the lack of faith and ignorance. If these are eliminated then the dragon has no power. [PAR] The image "

This condition prevents outward movement of the eye (toward the ear), and in some cases may also limit inward eye movement (toward the nose). As the eye moves inward, the eyelids partially close and the eyeball pulls back (retracts) into its socket. Most commonly, only one eye is affected. About 10 percent of people with isolated Duane retraction syndrome develop amblyopia (\"lazy eye\"), a condition that causes vision loss in the affected eye. [PAR] About 70 percent of all cases of Duane retraction syndrome are isolated, which means they occur without other signs and symptoms. Duane retraction syndrome can also occur as part of syndromes that affect other areas of the body. For example, Duane-radial ray syndrome is characterized by this eye disorder in conjunction with abnormalities of bones in the arms and hands. [PAR] Researchers have identified three forms of isolated Duane retraction syndrome, designated types I, II, and III. The types vary in which eye movements are most severely restricted (inward, outward, or both). All three types are characterized by retraction of the eyeball as the eye moves inward. "

Whenever he is apprehended for a crime, he is sent to an ordinary prison instead of Arkham Asylum, although some versions of the character (particularly the less sane interpretations) are sent to Arkham. [PAR] The Penguin does, however, possess a few eccentricities. He is known for his love of birds and his high-tech umbrellas that serve some specialized function, such as hang-gliding and weaponry. He also keeps beautiful women around him, perhaps to remind others of his monetary power or to compensate for his own grotesqueness. [PAR] Although a second-string villain for many years, Burgess Meredith popularized the Penguin in the 1960s Batman TV show, partially because of his signature squawking laughter. Danny DeVito played a much darker and older version of the Penguin in Batman Returns. This version was not just an unattractive criminal, but a physically deformed, sadistic, megalomaniacal monster. Subsequent Batman animated series have alternately featured the deformed Penguin and a more traditional version. [PAR] The deformed version of the character has also appeared in comics, most notably in the miniseries Batman: The Long Halloween and its sequel Dark Victory . He only appears for a minor cameo at the end of the Long Halloween, and has no lines. He plays a slightly more notable role in Dark Victory, when Batman goes to him for information. ",

Here, the eccentricities are trimmed back somewhat -- they still bubble up on \"The Millionaire Waltz,\" an example of the music hall pop that dominated Night, the pro-Native American saga \"White Man\" is undercut somewhat by the cowboys 'n' indians rhythms -- in favor of a driving, purposeful hard rock that still could have some slyly hidden perversities (or in the case of the opening \"Tie Your Mother Down,\" some not-so-hidden perversity) but this is exquisitely detailed hard rock, dense with minutiae but never lush or fussy. In a sense, it could even function as the bridge between Sheer Heart Attack and Night at the Opera -- it's every bit as hard as the former and nearly as florid as the latter -- but its sleek, streamlined finish is the biggest indication that Queen has entered a new phase, where they're globe-conquering titans instead of underdogs on the make.

            "context": " [PAR] History  [PAR] All the elements and isotopes we encounter on Earth, with the exceptions of hydrogen, deuterium, helium, helium-3, and perhaps trace amounts of stable lithium and beryllium isotopes which were created in the Big Bang, were created by the s-process or the r-process in stars, and for those to be today a part of the Earth, must have been created not later than 4.5 billion years ago. All the elements created more than 4.5 billion years ago are termed primordial, meaning they were generated by the universe's stellar processes. At the time when they were created, those that were unstable began decaying immediately. All the isotopes which have half-lives less than 100 million years have been reduced to 0.0000000000028% (%) or less of whatever original amounts were created and captured by Earth's accretion; they are of trace quantity today, or have decayed away altogether. There are only two other methods to create isotopes: artificially, inside a man-made (or perhaps a natural) reactor, or through decay of a parent isotopic species, the process known as the decay chain. [PAR] Unstable isotopes are in a continual struggle to become more stable; the ultimate goal is becoming one of the 200 or so stable isotopes in the universe.  Stable isotopes have ratios of neutrons to protons in their nucleus that start out at 1 in stable helium-4 and smoothly rise to ~1.5 for lead (there is no complete stability for anything heavier than lead-208). The elements heavier than that have to shed weight to achieve stability, most usually as alpha decay.  ",

The hostage develops positive feelings towards their captors and negative feelings towards authorities such as the police.

The hostage may also develop negative feelings towards authorities that are trying to help, such as the police or hostage negotiators. The hostage does not make a conscious decision to befriend the hostage taker, however by doing this the captors also develop positive feelings towards the hostage.

During summer months, their dietary preferences may shift to aquatic vegetation including water lilies and rhizomes from shoreline ferns. [PAR] As winter draws near, beaver may collect and store or cache food items underwater near the entrance to their lodge in what is termed a 'raft' or 'feedpile' for use throughout the winter.

[PAR] History [PAR] The word \"tabloid\" comes from the name given by the London-based pharmaceutical company Burroughs Wellcome & Co. to the compressed tablets they marketed as \"Tabloid\" pills in the late 1880s.   The connotation of tabloid was soon applied to other small compressed items. A 1902 item in London's Westminister Gazette noted, \"The proprietor intends to give in tabloid form all the news printed by other journals.\"  Thus \"tabloid journalism\" in 1901 originally meant a paper that condensed stories into a simplified, easily absorbed format. The term preceded the 1918 reference to smaller sheet newspapers that contained the condensed stories.  [PAR] Dimensions [PAR] A tabloid is defined as \"roughly 17 by\" and commonly \"half the size of a broadsheet\". [PAR] Types [PAR] Tabloid newspapers, especially in the United Kingdom, boast a very high degree of variation as far as target market, political alignment, editorial style, and circulation are concerned.  Thus, various terms have been coined to describe the subtypes of this versatile paper format.  There are, broadly, two main types of tabloid newspaper: red top and compact.  The distinction is largely of editorial style; both red top and compact tabloids span the width of the political spectrum from socialism to capitalist conservatism. "

For example, in the blister beetle illustration below, a collector should know that the basic nomenclature is as follows: [PAR] \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Class = Insecta [PAR] \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Genus = Epicauta [PAR] \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Species = pennsylvanica [PAR] All specimens in an insect collection should be identified at some level. Amateur collectors gain a good knowledge of insects by first classifying them according to their order name. An order is a name applied to a large group of insects having similar characteristics. For example, all butterflies and moths belong to the order Lepidoptera; all beetles, regardless of size, shape, or color, belong to the order Coleoptera; all flies belong to the order Diptera, and so forth.

Advertising Age magazine lists the slogan among the top 10 of all time - not bad. [PAR] There is a direct corollary between this slogan and investment decisions. Many investors want their investments to taste great, to provide premium returns, but be less filing, not have much risk. Most of the packaged investment products sold by brokers follow this time-tested maxim. [PAR] The problem is risk and return are related to one another. The reason many investors want to finesse this point is simple: fear. They fear they will lose money in the market. They fear things are different now than they were in the past. "

[PAR] But there are some that somehow seem to slip through the net. The name of one of the greatest ever National sportsmen in living memory will mean nothing much to the majority of young people today. Yet they will know of the name Red Rum, Ginger McCain and maybe even Tommy Stack who, of course, rode the legendary horse to his third and, arguably, greatest victory of all. But this, sadly, doesn\u2019t do justice to Brian Fletcher. [PAR] To look at how and why the National and Brian\u2019s fates seemed inextricably linked for almost a decade, we need to go back to 1968. The then 19-year old Geordie lad won the greatest race of them all on the 100-7 shot Red Alligator \u2013 a horse trained by Denys Smith which was carrying just 10 stones.

[PAR] A: [PAR] Quick Answer [PAR] The rules do not allow players to participate in polo left-handed. The original ban took effect in the 1930s because of safety concerns. Following World War II, the United States Polo Association lifted the ban but then reinstated it in 1974. [PAR] Full Answer [PAR] When left-handed players participate in polo, they tend to run head on into the right-handed players. This is because their polo sticks are on the same side as the right-handed players when they face each other. The result is an unpredictable game that could lead to injuries. [PAR] While left-handed people can still participate in the sport, they must hold the mallet in their right hands to ensure that they do not become a safety concern.[DOC] [TLE] In what sport are competitors forbidden to play left-handed?In what sport are competitors forbidden to play left-handed? | Reference.com [PAR] In what sport are competitors forbidden to play left-handed? [PAR] A: [PAR] Quick Answer [PAR] The official rules of polo strictly prohibit players from hitting the ball using a mallet held in their left-hand. The rule is designed to protect players from clobbering each other during a polo match. [PAR] Full Answer [PAR] The \"no left-handed player\" rule was originally implemented during the 1930s, but relaxed around the time following the end of World War II. However, the United States Polo Association reinstated the rule for good in 1974. [PAR] Polo takes place on horseback and is a team sport. Similar to hockey and soccer, the idea in polo is to score goals, which are located on either end of a polo field. The ball is moved through the use of a long-handled wooden mallet."

Released amidst a whirlwind of publicity, the album was a commercial success, earning gold status and nearly climbing its way into the Top Ten, but it wasn't a return to form. Produced by Don Costa , the album doesn't follow the sound of Sinatra 's last handful of albums ( Sinatra & Company , Watertown , A Man Alone , My Way ), jettisoning then-recent pop hits for selections by upcoming songwriters, particularly Joe Raposo , as well as several current film and Broadway numbers. Much of the material is unmemorable, featuring slight melodies and clich\u00e9d, underdeveloped lyrics. The noticeable exceptions are \"Send in the Clowns\" and the moving \"There Used to Be a Ballpark,\" both featuring sublime, subtle arrangements from Gordon Jenkins and outstanding singing by Sinatra . However, Jenkins ' arrangements are undercut by the lethargic, uneventful production by Costa . Not that Jenkins ' arrangements are all perfect -- on \"Noah,\" one of the worst songs Sinatra ever recorded, his writing actually accentuates the banality of Raposo 's tune. "

Twenty years after the defining match of his career, Randy is still a fan favorite and loving his work--until he suffers a heart attack.

Influence from other regions, mainly Imperial China, followed by periods of isolation, particularly from Western Europe, has characterized Japan's history. From the 12th century until 1868, Japan was ruled by successive feudal military shoguns who ruled in the name of the Emperor. Japan entered into a long period of isolation in the early 17th century, which was ended in 1853 when a United States fleet pressured Japan to open to the West. Nearly two decades of internal conflict and insurrection followed before the Meiji Emperor was restored as head of state in 1868 and the Empire of Japan was proclaimed, with the Emperor as a divine symbol of the nation. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, victories in the First Sino-Japanese War, the Russo-Japanese War and World War I allowed Japan to expand its empire during a period of increasing militarism. The Second Sino-Japanese War of 1937 expanded into part of World War II in 1941, which came to an end in 1945 following the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Since adopting its revised constitution in 1947, Japan has maintained a unitary constitutional monarchy with an Emperor and an elected legislature called the National Diet.

Open iTunes to buy and download music. [PAR] Biography [PAR] Sheryl Crow's fresh, updated spin on classic roots rock made her one of the most popular mainstream rockers of the '90s. Her albums were loose and eclectic on the surface, yet were generally tied together by polished, professional songcraft. Crow's sunny, good-time rockers and world-weary ballads were radio staples for much of the '90s, and she was a perennial favorite at Grammy time. Although her songwriting style was firmly anchored to the rock tradition, she wasn't a slave to it -- her free-associative, reference-laden poetry could hardly have been the product of any era but the '90s. Her production not only kept pace with contemporary trends, but sometimes even pushed the envelope of what sounds could be heard on a classicist rock album, especially on her self-titled sophomore effort. All of this made Crow one of the most dependable stars of the decade, and she showed no signs of relinquishing her hard-won success in the new millennium.  Sheryl Suzanne Crow was born February 11, 1962, in Kennett, Missouri. "

There was little the Chinese government wanted from the West at the time but there was a strong demand for opium among the population. In the Opium Wars of 1839-1842 and 1856-1860, the British forced the Chinese to accept the import of opium in return for Chinese goods, and trading centres were established at major ports. The largest of these was Shanghai, where French, German, British, and American merchants demanded large tracts of land in which they asserted \"extra-territorial\" rights - being subject to the laws of their own country rather than Chinese law. According to popular myth, a sign at Huangpu\u00a0Park near a European compound read: \"No dogs or Chinamen\".

Raw meat packed in a carbon monoxide atmosphere also shows this same pink \"smoke ring\" due to the same principles. Notably, the surface of this raw meat also displays the pink color, which is usually associated in consumers' minds with fresh meat.

            "context": "Jackson Pollock and that's a mouthful.. I was a woman, Jewish, a widow, a damn good painter, thank you, and a little too independent.\" [PAR] Synopsis [PAR] An ambitious and important artist in New York City during Abstract Expressionism's heyday, Lee Krasner's own career often was compromised by her role as supportive wife to Jackson Pollock, arguably the most significant postwar American painter, as well as by the male-dominated art world. Krasner was intimately involved in the synthesis of abstract form and psychological content, which announced the advent of Abstract Expressionism. Her desire to revise her aesthetic or what she called \"breaks,\" led to her innovative Little Imageseries of the late 1940s, her bold collages of the 1950s, and, later, her large canvases, brilliant with color, of the 1960s. Krasner was \"rediscovered\" by feminist art historians during the 1970s and lived to see a greater recognition of her art and career, which continues to grow to this day. [PAR] Key Ideas [PAR] Krasner was a key transitional figure within abstraction, who connected early-twentieth-century art with the new ideas of postwar America. Inspired by artist Piet Mondrian's \"grid,\" Krasner helped devise the \"all-over\" technique, which in turn influenced Pollock's revolutionary \"drip paintings.\" [PAR] Krasner was remarkable for her artistic versatility and advanced skill, which, coupled with her intensive training in art theory, enabled her to revise her style and technique multiple times over the course of her career. Krasner purposefully initiated these \"breaks\" in order to distance herself from such artists as Mark Rothko and Barnett Newman, whose work she ",

His wife Penelope, meanwhile, has been harassed by dozens of suitors who have come to win her hand in marriage.

However, when alone at night, Penelope secretly undoes the work of the shroud so that the fabrication of the garment will go on indefinitely. Unfortunately, the ruse has been discovered by the suitors, who now demand she choose one of them immediately. [PAR] The suitors, who have been awaiting her decision for several years, have in the meantime spent their days feasting in Odysseus\u2019 hall.

This condition prevents outward movement of the eye (toward the ear), and in some cases may also limit inward eye movement (toward the nose). As the eye moves inward, the eyelids partially close and the eyeball pulls back (retracts) into its socket. Most commonly, only one eye is affected. About 10 percent of people with isolated Duane retraction syndrome develop amblyopia (\"lazy eye\"), a condition that causes vision loss in the affected eye. [PAR] About 70 percent of all cases of Duane retraction syndrome are isolated, which means they occur without other signs and symptoms. Duane retraction syndrome can also occur as part of syndromes that affect other areas of the body. For example, Duane-radial ray syndrome is characterized by this eye disorder in conjunction with abnormalities of bones in the arms and hands. [PAR] Researchers have identified three forms of isolated Duane retraction syndrome, designated types I, II, and III.

Originally, the car\u2019s rear-mounted power plant was to be a Citro\u00ebn Wankel rotary engine, but was replaced with a French-designed and produced PRV (Peugeot-Renault-Volvo) fuel injected V-6 because of the poor fuel economy from the rotary engine, an important issue at a time of world-wide fuel shortages. Collins and De Lorean envisioned a chassis produced from a new and untested manufacturing technology known as Elastic Reservoir Moulding (ERM), which would contribute to the light-weight characteristics of the car while presumably lowering its production costs. This new technology, for which De Lorean had purchased patent rights, would eventually be found to be unsuitable for mass production. [PAR] These and other changes to the original concept led to considerable schedule pressures. The entire car was deemed to require almost complete re-engineering, which was turned over to engineer Colin Chapman, founder and owner of Lotus. Chapman replaced most of the unproven material and manufacturing techniques with those currently being employed by Lotus. The Backbone chassis is very similar to the Lotus Esprit. The original Giorgetto Giugiaro body design was left mostly intact, as were the distinctive stainless steel outer skin panels and gull-wing doors. ",

Ommetaphobia develops when someone has a bad situation or traumatic event occur in their life involving eyes (i.e., seeing an eye pop out of the socket, getting hit in the eye, going blind in an eye, etc.). Ommetaphobia is considered a social phobia because it involves social situations (i.e., looking into someone\u2019s eyes, touching your eyes, things getting into your eyes, etc.).

Pompey married Caesar\u2019s daughter, Julia in 59 BC, with the intent that this would strengthen the bond between these two men since they had been on opposite sides during the war between Marius and Sulla. Crassus had also supported Sulla against Marius but Crassus had been saved by Caesar during the Catiline affair. Crassus had shared a consulship with Pompey during which the two men argued almost constantly. Crassus also never forgave Pompey for stealing the glory for the defeat of Spartacus. Thus it was a political partnership very much designed by Caesar. Shortly thereafter, Caesar departed from Rome to assume the conquest of Gaul (59-49 BC), leaving Pompey and Crassus in charge of administration in the capital city. [PAR] Unfortunately, the bonds between Pompey and Caesar were not altogether that strong and Julia proved to be the great mediator. Unfortunately, Julia died in 54 BC while in childbirth.

            "context": "Its appeal is often ascribed to its relative simplicity; a single melodic motif dominates and it both begins and ends with scored silence. However, as the critic Ivan Hewett observes, while it \"may be simple in concept...the concept produces a tangle of lines which is hard for the ear to unravel. And even where the music really is simple in its audible features, the expressive import of those features is anything but.\" [PAR] The cantus was composed as an elegy to mourn the December 1976 death of the English composer Benjamin Britten. P\u00e4rt greatly admired Britten. P\u00e4rt described Britten as possessing the \"unusual purity\" that he himself sought as a composer. P\u00e4rt viewed the Englishman as a kindred spirit; however, he gained access to the latter's music only in 1980, after emigrating from Soviet Estonia to Austria, four years after Britten had died. When Britten died, P\u00e4rt felt that he had lost hope of meeting the only contemporary composer whose musical outlook, he believed, resembled his own. [PAR] Although P\u00e4rt is known primarily for his religious music, Cantus is a fully secular work, in that it forms a spare lament to a fellow composer not based on biblical texts. It is perhaps P\u00e4rt's most popular piece, and a 1997 recording by the Hungarian State Opera Orchestraconducted by Tamas Benedek has been widely distributed. Due to its evocative and cinematic feel, the piece has been used extensively as background accompaniment in both film and television documentaries.

He treated the old satyr hospitably and after returning him to the god was rewarded with a wish. He prayed for a golden touch--a boon which quickly proved  a curse when the king discovered his food also transformed. Petitioning the god again, he was instructed to bathe in the river Paktolos (Pactolus) which not only rid him of the power but also imbued the river's sands with gold.

Pompey married Caesar\u2019s daughter, Julia in 59 BC, with the intent that this would strengthen the bond between these two men since they had been on opposite sides during the war between Marius and Sulla. Crassus had also supported Sulla against Marius but Crassus had been saved by Caesar during the Catiline affair. Crassus had shared a consulship with Pompey during which the two men argued almost constantly. Crassus also never forgave Pompey for stealing the glory for the defeat of Spartacus. Thus it was a political partnership very much designed by Caesar. Shortly thereafter, Caesar departed from Rome to assume the conquest of Gaul (59-49 BC), leaving Pompey and Crassus in charge of administration in the capital city. [PAR] Unfortunately, the bonds between Pompey and Caesar were not altogether that strong and Julia proved to be the great mediator. Unfortunately, Julia died in 54 BC while in childbirth. Crassus was killed in 53 BC, while undertaking an expedition into Mesopotamia against the Parthians. With both Julia and Crassus gone, there was little to prevent these two men from drifting apart. While Caesar\u2019s conquest of Gaul was starting to rival Pompey\u2019s past victories, Pompey was getting jealous at losing his place of honor in military history. "

The hostage does not make a conscious decision to befriend the hostage taker, however by doing this the captors also develop positive feelings towards the hostage.

By 1931 they were recognized as having special status within the empire by the Statute of Westminster , which referred specifically to a \u201cBritish Commonwealth of Nations.\u201d The rapid growth of nationalism in other parts of the empire from the 1920s produced a long series of grants of independence, beginning with that to India in 1947, and required a redefinition of the Commonwealth.

In 1949 India announced its intention to become a republic , which would have required its withdrawal from the Commonwealth under the existing rules, but at a meeting of Commonwealth heads of government in London in April 1949 it was agreed that India could continue its membership if it accepted the British crown as only \u201cthe symbol of the free association\u201d of Commonwealth members.

Rheumatic fever, which he first contracted as a child, damaged his heart and ultimately contributed to his death. An early British rock and roll (and film) star, he equalled The Beatles' record of 24 hits in the 1960s, and spent 332 weeks on the UK charts, without a chart-topping single or album. Allmusic journalist, Bruce Eder, stated, \"His mix of rough-hewn good looks and unassuming masculinity, coupled with an underlying vulnerability, all presented with a good voice and some serious musical talent, helped turn Fury into a major rock and roll star in short order\". Others have suggested that it was Fury's \"Elvis Presley-influenced, hip-swivelling, and at times highly suggestive stage act.\" [PAR] (extract from Wikipedia 2011)[DOC] [TLE] Billy Fury ::::: Colette.

The initial 1998 paper by the APG made angiosperms the first large group of organisms to be systematically re-classified primarily on the basis of genetic characteristics.

The existed systems are rejected is because they are not phylogenetically classified. The outline of a phylogenetic tree of all flowering plants became established and several well supported major clades involving many families of flowering plants were identified. The new knowledge of phylogeny revealed relationships in conflict with the then widely used modern classifications.

Four workers had been shot and killed by police on May 4th, 1886 in Chicago while demonstrating for the eight-hour week.3 Known as the Haymarket Affair, it became a cause c\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdl\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdbre among labour movements, and along with other disturbances during a period of great social unrest, led to the declaring of May 1st as International Labour Day.  In 1936, wide-spread demonstrations on May 1st led to the formation of the first centre-left government in France which quickly introduced the 40-hour work week, two weeks paid holiday and the right to form a union.

In inorganic chemistry, salts containing the C\u2261N\u2212 ion are referred to as cyanides.

Cyanides are found in substantial amounts in certain seeds and fruit stones, e.g., those of apricots, apples, and peaches.  In plants, cyanides are usually bound to sugar molecules in the form of cyanogenic glycosides and defend the plant against herbivores. Cassava roots (also called manioc), an important potato-like food grown in tropical countries (and the base from which tapioca is made), also contain cyanogenic glycosides.

Unlike most microbial killers that invade and infect our bodies, Clostridium botulinum does not cause disease as most pathogenic bacteria do (Ingraham, p.233). C. botulinum produces its toxin wherever it may be living and when we consume it we become sick or die. Two main characteristics make c. botulinum hazardous: it is an anaerobe, and it produces endospores (Ingraham, p.233). Because c. botulinum is Anaerobic organisms such as c.botulinum do not require oxygen for growth; therefore, they can grow in oxygen free places such as canned goods. The ability to produce endospores makes it easier to survive under extreme harsh conditions. Endospores form when bacteria run out of nutrients; hence, they germinate, grow, and produce the botulinum toxin called Botox. Active ingredients in Botox and Botox Cosmetic include botulinum toxin type A, while inactive ingredients include human albumin and sodium chloride (U.S. "

            "context": "[PAR] Nomenclature and etymology [PAR] In IUPAC nomenclature, organic compounds that have a\u00a0\u2013C\u2261N functional group are called nitriles. Thus, nitriles are organic compounds.   [PAR] An example of a nitrile is CH3CN, acetonitrile, also known as methyl cyanide. Nitriles usually do not release cyanide ions. A functional group with a hydroxyl and cyanide bonded to the same carbon is called cyanohydrin. Unlike nitriles, cyanohydridins do release hydrogen cyanide. In inorganic chemistry, salts containing the C\u2261N\u2212 ion are referred to as cyanides. [PAR] The word is derived from the Greek kyanos, meaning dark blue, as a result of its being first obtained by the heating of the pigment known as Prussian blue. [PAR] Occurrence and reactions [PAR] In nature [PAR] Cyanides are produced by certain bacteria, fungi, and algae and are found in a number of plants. Cyanides are found in substantial amounts in certain seeds and fruit stones, e.g., those of apricots, apples, and peaches.  In plants, cyanides are usually bound to sugar molecules in the form of cyanogenic glycosides and defend the plant against herbivores. Cassava roots (also called manioc), an important potato-like food grown in tropical countries (and the base from which tapioca is made), also contain cyanogenic glycosides.  [PAR] The Madagascar bamboo Cathariostachys madagascariensis produces cyanide as a deterrent to grazing. ",

The new tv spots were fashioned as what Sturken & Cartwright call \"anti-ads\"(p.296).

Species of the genus Antirrhinum (Veronicaceae) provide excellent opportunities for research on plant evolution given their extensive morphological and ecological diversity. These opportunities are enhanced by genetic and developmental data from the model organism Antirrhinum majus. The genus Antirrhinum includes 15 New World species in the section Saerorhinum and 21 Old World species in the sections Antirrhinum and Orontium. The species, which belong to the botanical genus Antirrhinum, are distributed around the Mediterranean Sea, Iberian Peninsula being considered its genetic center as it harbors most of the diversity of the genus. Most of the species are narrow range endemics and several of them are under threat. Wild species of Antirrhinum are perennial diploids. Wild species of Antirrhinum are self-incompatible and cross-pollinated. This chapter aims at providing information on species distribution, uses, conservation efforts, variability assessment, species used in hybridization exploiting heterosis, scope for commercialization, and recommendations for future.

Obviously, a shot that shows two people is a two-shot, three people make a three-shot, and so on; however, when five or six people are pictured it is called a group-shot. A crowd-shot is when a large group of 20 or more people is being framed. [PAR] BASIC SEQUENCE [PAR] During motion-media recording, you can change the image size by changing the camera-to-subject distance or by using a zoom lens (which also changes the field of view). [PAR] When recording an event on motion media, there are three basic shots or sequences you must use: long shots (LS), medium shots (MS), and closeup shots (CU) (fig. 13-10). The type of shot being used can limit or increase the amount of visual information presented to the viewer. Long shots generally establish a location. A medium shot is used primarily as a transition between a long shot and closeup shot. Closeup shots create impact and provide more detail and less visual information pertaining to the subject's surroundings. [PAR] Shot classifications can be broken down into ",

The initial 1998 paper by the APG made angiosperms the first large group of organisms to be systematically re-classified primarily on the basis of genetic characteristics. The group emphasized the need for a classification system for angiosperms at the level of families, orders and above. The existed systems are rejected is because they are not phylogenetically classified. The outline of a phylogenetic tree of all flowering plants became established and several well supported major clades involving many families of flowering plants were identified. The new knowledge of phylogeny revealed relationships in conflict with the then widely used modern classifications.

Saliva also makes the food easier to swallow. [PAR] The Digestive Tract: Several organs make up a bird's digestive tract. From the bill, food moves down a tube called the esophagus and into the crop , which stores excess food so the bird can digest it slowly. The food then moves to the proventriculous, the first part of the stomach, where it is softened by gastric acid, mucus and other digestive juices. The second part of the stomach, the gizzard , grinds the food into smaller pieces, often with the aid of grit such as sand or small stones the bird has swallowed earlier. If the food is particularly tough, it may move between the proventriculous and the gizzard several times for more efficient digestion. Once the food is sufficiently broken down, it moves into the small intestine, where the liver and pancreas help with absorbing nutrients. Next is the large intestine, which is very short for most birds. Where the small and large intestines join are the ceca, two pouches that help absorb any remaining water from the food and finish the digestive process.

[PAR] In 1822, the Santa Fe Trail brought hundreds and hundreds of wagons through Kansas, and as the population grew, Kansas became a state in 1861. Cattle drives and railroads continued to change the face of the state, and Dodge City became home to the largest cattle market in the world, gaining notoriety in the process as the rough and tumbling home to the likes of Wyatt Earp, Wild Bill Hickok, and Bat Masterson. Today, cattle, wheat, corn, and soybeans form the base for the agricultural economy. [PAR] THE STATE NAME: [PAR] The state of Kansas was named after the river. [PAR] The Kansas River was named by the French after the Kansas, Omaha, Kaw, Osage and Dakota Sioux Indian word \"KaNze\" meaning, in the Kansas language \"south wind.\" The state name for Arkansas shares its origins with Kansas.

His failure to make the medal round might have been due to an extra-musical circumstance: he constantly made weird faces and appeared to be muttering in some private language while he played. The fact that a video camera projected a close up of his face on a large screen that hung from the top of the stage made it all the worse.

The bacteria may enter the body through wounds, or by eating them from improperly canned or preserved food. [PAR] Causes [PAR] Clostridium botulinum is found in soil and untreated water throughout the world. It produces spores that survive in improperly preserved or canned food, where they produce a toxin. When eaten, even tiny amounts of this toxin can lead to severe poisoning. Foods that can be contaminated are home-canned vegetables, cured pork and ham, smoked or raw fish, and honey or corn syrup, baked potatoes cooked in foil, carrot juice, and chopped garlic in oil. [PAR] Infant botulism occurs when a baby eats spores and the bacteria grow in the baby's gastrointestinal tract. The most common cause of infant botulism is eating honey or corn syrup, or using pacifiers that have been coated with contaminated honey. [PAR] Clostridium botulinum can be found normally in the stool of some infants. Infants develop botulism when the bacteria grow in their gut.

            "context": "Furthermore, the name \"George\" comes from the noun \u03b3\u03b5\u03ce\u03c1\u03b3\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd which denotes a farm or a cultivated field. This could be an epithet for a person who is going through spiritual cultivation. In hymnography St. George is called the \"cultivator of Christ\". [PAR] St. George as a horseman and dragonslayer is related to water and wells. And the deprivation of water in the summer months, especially if it doesn't rain during the winter, could be a source of great suffering in places like Greece, Asia Minor and the Middle East. The dragon who breathes flames from his mouth is keeping the water of the area hostage - as the tale says - and it will not allow it to flow unless the princess is sacrificed to the dragon. Therefore, St. George slays the dragon and saves the princess. [PAR] Some would argue that the princess in the icon merely depicts Empress Alexandra, the wife of Diocletian, who converted to Christianity upon witnessing the sufferings of St. George and was martyred with him. Her image in icons with St. George could have inspired the later symbolic imagery and the narrative of St. George slaying the dragon to save the princess. [PAR] The dragon also symbolizes the wicked serpent, the devil, as we read in Revelation 12:9. The battle against the dragon could indicate the spiritual battle against the devil and evil for the salvation of the soul. The fear of the dragon is the lack of faith and ignorance. If these are eliminated then the dragon has no power. [PAR] The image ",

He was sometimes insensitive, sometimes unorthodoxed but as       played by Conrad, was a likeable curmudgeon never the less. It was said       that Conrad, who went on to play Nero Wolfe, did this show as a favor to       Quinn Martin who was a friend.

There was, however, often a crossover between town and county with some strong local clubs tending at times to represent a whole county. "

He studied English at Cambridge, then, like his father, became an antique dealer, revealing his expertise in Wedgwood (1953), The Portland Vase (1952), and A Concise Encyclopedia of English Pottery and Porcelain (1957) with R.G. Haggar. He turned increasingly to literature and wrote a number of books inspired by his childhood recollections of the East End. These include A Kid for Two Farthings (1953), the title of which was suggested by the Passover allegorical ditty *\u1e24ad Gadya; Make Me An Offer (1952); The Boychick (1954); and The Mendelman Fire (1957). In his early writing, Mankowitz's Jewishness was somewhat muted, revealing itself merely in a preference for Jewish characters. His typical mingling of humor and pathos comes out strongly in the play, The Bespoke Overcoat (1955), a Jewish reworking of a Russian tale by Gogol. Like several of his other stories, this was made into a motion picture. ",

Following World War II, the United States Polo Association lifted the ban but then reinstated it in 1974. [PAR] Full Answer [PAR] When left-handed players participate in polo, they tend to run head on into the right-handed players. This is because their polo sticks are on the same side as the right-handed players when they face each other. The result is an unpredictable game that could lead to injuries.

The genus Antirrhinum includes 15 New World species in the section Saerorhinum and 21 Old World species in the sections Antirrhinum and Orontium. The species, which belong to the botanical genus Antirrhinum, are distributed around the Mediterranean Sea, Iberian Peninsula being considered its genetic center as it harbors most of the diversity of the genus. Most of the species are narrow range endemics and several of them are under threat. Wild species of Antirrhinum are perennial diploids. Wild species of Antirrhinum are self-incompatible and cross-pollinated.
