Abane Ramdane was recruited to take control of the FLN's Algiers campaign, and went on to become one of its most effective leaders. By 1956 nearly all the nationalist organizations in Algeria had joined the FLN, which had established itself as the main nationalist group through both co-opting and coercing smaller organizations; the most important group that remained outside the FLN was Messali Hadj's Algerian National Movement (MNA). At this time the FLN reorganized into something like a provisional government, consisting of a five-man executive and legislative body, and was organized territorially into six wilayas, following the Ottoman-era administrative boundaries.  [PAR] The FLN's armed wing during the war was called the National Liberation Army (ALN). It was divided into guerrilla units fighting France and the MNA in Algeria (and wrestling with Messali's followers over control of the expatriate community, in the \"Caf\u00e9 Wars\" in France), and another, stronger component more resembling a traditional army. These units were based in neighbouring Berber countries (notably in Oujda in Morocco, and Tunisia), and although they infiltrated forces and ran weapons and supplies across the border, they generally saw less action than the rural guerrilla forces.

However, Cammarano died in mid-1852 before completing the libretto, forcing Verdi to turn to the young librettist, Leone Bardare, for revisions. [PAR] The title \"La traviata\" means literally The Woman Who Strayed, or perhaps more figuratively, The Fallen One and is a tragic tale of a courtesan who falls in love. Despite being a staple of the modern standard operatic repertoire, the opera bombed when it was first performed at the Teatro la Fenice in Venice, on March 6, 1853, due to what was regarded as its rather scurrilous subject matter.

The original castle on     the site was built in the years that followed for the Stewarts of Menteith. As     originally constructed, the castle was protected by a steep slope descending on     its seaward side, and a water filled ditch on its landward side. The castle     itself comprised a tower which became the east end of the later building, with     a wall of enclosure to its west containing a series of domestic buildings     including a kitchen, stables and a chapel.

While his parched and effeminate falsetto recalls Gasoline Alley -era Rod Stewart with a healthy dose of Antony and the Johnsons , it's the late Elliott Smith who casts the largest shadow on Back to Bedlam . Predictable but effective four-chord guitar motifs are the chosen vehicle for the ex-Royal Armed Forces soldier, and when they connect (\"Wiseman,\" \"Goodbye My Lover,\" \"You Are Beautiful\"), it's like a \"Dear John\" letter from a lover who you know will remain a close but ultimately guarded friend. Opening track \"High\" sets a determined midtempo pace that rarely wanes -- it's like an acoustic version of \"Drive\" by the Cars with a Coldplay chorus. It's a pace that would sink some records, but Bedlam 's perfectly rendered, under 40-minute run time ensures that the listener doesn't suffer from a melancholy overdose. Blunt recounts his harrowing experiences as part of the NATO peacekeeping force in Kosovo on the closer, \"No Bravery,\" and it's a shock to hear all of the romantic lyricism that informed Bedlam up to this point reduced to \"Old men kneel and accept their fate/Wives and daughters cut and raped/A generation drenched in hate,\" but it's damn effective -- as is the majority of this fine debut.

You may also know it by its proper title of \"Vedi!

However, Cammarano died in mid-1852 before completing the libretto, forcing Verdi to turn to the young librettist, Leone Bardare, for revisions. [PAR] The title \"La traviata\" means literally The Woman Who Strayed, or perhaps more figuratively, The Fallen One and is a tragic tale of a courtesan who falls in love. Despite being a staple of the modern standard operatic repertoire, the opera bombed when it was first performed at the Teatro la Fenice in Venice, on March 6, 1853, due to what was regarded as its rather scurrilous subject matter. [PAR] Il Trovatore takes as its basis the novel The Lady of the Camellias (French: La Dame aux cam\u00e9lias) with the female protagonist \"Marguerite Gautier\" renamed \"Violetta Val\u00e9ry.\" [PAR] During the early twentieth century, the Anvil Chorus was commonly sung by American spectators attending sporting events, or played by a band, when an opponent committed an error.

Pliny said that Topazos is a legendary island in the Red Sea and the mineral \"topaz\" was first mined there. Alternatively, the word topaz may be related to the Sanskrit word \u0924\u092a\u0938\u094d \"tapas\", meaning \"heat\" or \"fire\". [PAR] Historical usage [PAR] Nicols, the author of one of the first systematic treatises on minerals and gemstones, dedicated two chapters to the topic in 1652.  In the Middle Ages, the name topaz was used to refer to any yellow gemstone, but in modern times it denotes only the silicate described above. [PAR] Many modern English translations of the Bible, including the King James Version mention topaz.  However, because these translations as topaz all derive from the Septuagint translation topazi[os], which as mentioned above referred to a yellow stone that was not topaz, but probably chrysolite (chrysoberyl or peridot), it should be borne in mind that topaz is likely not meant here.

Reserving pride of place for a samovar at the festive table is both a tribute that Russians give to their ancestors and a ceremony that embodies warm-hearted hospitality. [PAR] What is a Samovar? [PAR] A samovar is a device traditionally used to heat and boil water for tea. The word samovar in Russian is derived from \"\u0441\u0430\u043c\" meaning self and \"\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0442\u044c\" meaning to boil. The name can be loosely translated into English as \"self-boiler\". Samovars are made from metal and consist of a large urn-shaped container and a metal pipe running vertically through the middle. To boil the water inside a samovar, the pipe is filled with solid fuel such as pine cones, charcoals and wood chips which are set on fire. A small tea pot is used to brew a tea concentrate. The tea pot is often placed on top of a samovar to keep it heated with the passing hot air. ",

The figures were done almost entirely without models, and the dry, blowing grass can be seen from my studio window in the late summer or autumn.

            "context": "| Middle School Teacher | (Level 3) Educator Emeritus [PAR] Posted on [PAR] July 15, 2012 at 6:14 AM [PAR] It is speculated that when Shakespeare set Much Ado About Nothing in Messina, he was actually thinking of Venice, which was one of the most corrupt cities of his time period ( \"The Artificiality of Messinian Society,\" eNotes ). Venice was extremely wealthy as they had a monopoly over trade in China due to the success of the Venetian explorer, Marco Polo, who opened trade routes between Beijing and Europe. Due to the city's wealth, the city's wealthy families were constantly competing with each other for grander palaces and more power. The city's wealthy also ruled the government. Venice was called a republic, however, the Great Council ruled the city, which consisted of the wealthiest and most influential families of Venice. The Great Council selected all public officials, including the Senate body, who elected the Council of Ten. The Council of Ten where the highest administrators and made decisions for the city in secret ( \"Venice During the Renaissance\" ). Hence, since Venice was really a wealthy totalitarian city who passed itself off as a republic, we can see that Venice was extremely corrupt and embodied the theme of appearances vs. reality that dominates Shakespeare's play. [PAR] Dogberry actually expresses this theme very well when he lists his attributes, which are his position of power, his wealth, and his beauty, which we see in his lines: [PAR] I am a wise fellow; and which is more, an officer; and which is more, a householder, and which is more, as pretty a piece of flesh as any is in Messina, and one that knows the law, go to! and a rich fellow enough, go to!

[PAR] Callaghan was born on 27 March 1912 in Portsmouth and began working life for the Inland Revenue at the age of 16. He served in the Royal Navy during World War Two and in 1945 was elected Labour member of parliament for Cardiff South. In 1964, he was chosen by Labour prime minister Harold Wilson to be chancellor of the exchequer. His effectiveness at the Treasury, however, was limited by his resolute refusal to devalue the pound, which left British exports highly uncompetitive, and also by a power struggle with George Brown's Department of Economic Affairs, a new ministry deliberately created by Wilson to limit the power of the treasury. When devaluation became unavoidable in 1967, Callaghan was moved to the home office. Here he adopted an authoritarian and conservative line. He also took the decision to deploy British troops to Northern Ireland in 1969 after sectarian violence in the province. [PAR] Callaghan also made a decisive intervention against Barbara Castle's plans for a wages policy in 1969, a move that reinforced his credentials as a staunch ally of the trade unions, but also contributed to the unravelling of Labour's economic strategy in the 1970s.

This label has never been found or confirmed.[14] Amati would also have been a logical choice for Antonio's parents, as he represented an old family of violin makers in Cremona, and was far superior to most other luthiers in Italy.[13] [PAR] An alternative theory is that Stradivari started out as a woodworker: the house he lived in from 1667 to 1680 was owned by Francesco Pescaroli, a woodcarver and inlayer. Stradivari may even have been employed to decorate some of Amati's instruments, without being a true apprentice. This theory is supported by some of Stradivari's later violins, which have elaborate decorations and purfling.[16] [PAR] Assuming that Stradivari was a student of Amati, he would have begun his apprenticeship in 1656\u201358 and produced his first decent instruments in 1660, at the age of 16. His first labels were printed from 1660 to 1665, which indicates that his work had reached a quality sufficiently high enough for him to offer it directly to his patrons.

[PAR] Structure [PAR] There are a number of structural characteristics common to all cyclones.  A cyclone is a low-pressure area.   A cyclone's center (often known in a mature tropical cyclone as the eye), is the area of lowest atmospheric pressure in the region.  Near the center, the pressure gradient force (from the pressure in the center of the cyclone compared to the pressure outside the cyclone) and the force from the Coriolis effect must be in an approximate balance, or the cyclone would collapse on itself as a result of the difference in pressure.  [PAR] Because of the Coriolis effect, the wind flow around a large cyclone is counterclockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere.  In the Northern Hemisphere, the fastest winds relative to the surface of the  Earth therefore occur on the eastern side of a northward-moving cyclone and on the northern side of a westward-moving one; the opposite occurs in the Southern Hemisphere.   In contrast to low pressure systems, the wind flow around high pressure systems are clockwise (anticyclonic) in the northern hemisphere, and counterclockwise in the southern hemisphere.

[PAR] Odds [PAR] The National Hole in One Association, which tracks holes-in-one and sets odds for the feat, states that an albatross is less likely than an elusive hole-in-one. The association sets a golfer's odds of making a hole-in-one at 12,700 to 1 or, for a professional, 3,700 to 1. The odds of achieving an albatross, meanwhile, are set at 6 million to 1. [PAR] Considerations [PAR] One of the factors that makes scoring an albatross even more difficult is that most golf courses only provide golfers with two to five opportunities to achieve the feat. "

            "context": "Gregory we learn that twelve other monasteries in the vicinity of Subiaco also owed their origin to him, and that when he was obliged to leave that neighbourhood he founded the celebrated Abbey of Monte Cassino , which eventually become the centre whence his Rule and institute spread. These fourteen are the only monasteries of which there is any reliable evidence of having been founded during St. Benedict's lifetime. The tradition of St. Placid's mission to Sicily in 534, which first gained general credence in the eleventh century, though accepted as genuine by such writers as Mabillon and Ruinart, is now generally admitted to be mere romance. Very little more can be said in favour of the supposed introduction of the Benedictine Rule into Gaul by St. Maurus in 543, though it also has been strenuously upheld by many responsible writers. At any rate, evidences for it are so extremely doubtful that it cannot be seriously regarded as historical. There is reason for believing that it was the third Abbot of Monte Cassino who began to spread a knowledge of the Rule beyond the circle of St. Benedict's own foundations. It is at least certain that when Monte Cassino was sacked by the Lombards about the year 580, the monks fled to Rome , where they were housed by Pope Pelagius II in a monastery adjoining the Lateran Basilica . There, in the very centre of the ecclesiastical world, they remained for upwards of a hundred and forty years, and it seems highly probable that this residence in so prominent a position constituted an important factor in the diffusion of a knowledge of Benedictine monasticism.

The fleet initially consisted of chartered sailing ships, RMS Tayleur,Blue Jacket, White Star, Red Jacket, Ellen, Ben Nevis, Emma, Mermaid and Iowa. The fate of Tayleur, the largest ship of its day, haunted the company for years, for it was wrecked on its maiden voyage to Australia at Lambay Island, near Ireland. The company acquired its first steamship in 1863, the Royal Standard. [PAR] The original White Star Line merged with two other small lines, Black Ball and Eagle, to form a conglomerate, the Liverpool, Melbourne and Oriental Steam Navigation Company Limited. This did not prosper and White Star broke away. White Star concentrated on the Liverpool toNew York service. Heavy investment in new ships was financed by borrowing, but the company's bank, the Royal Bank of Liverpool, failed in October 1867. White Star was left with an outstanding debt of \u00a3527,000, and was forced into bankruptcy. [PAR] The Oceanic Steam Navigation Company [PAR] Edit [PAR] On 18 January 1868, Thomas Ismay, a director of the National Line, purchased the house flag, trade name, and goodwill of the bankrupt company for \u00a31,000, with the intention of operating large ships on the North Atlantic service. Ismay established the company's headquarters at Albion House, Liverpool. [PAR] Adriatic of 1871, ",

Tigers as we know them, you see, have never lived in the wild in Africa. But there's still a chance you could see one there. Let us explain. [PAR] Lions, leopards and tigers are all part of the Felidae family of cats, which originated in Africa and share a common ancestor. At some point, probably around 2 million years ago, one offshoot of Felidae migrated east toward Asia, and those cats evolved into the orange-, black-, and white-striped beasts we know today. Once established in Asia, however, tigers never returned to Africa, although scientists aren't exactly sure why. [PAR] \"One can offer a series of speculations about why tigers did not get to Africa, but they are all speculations,\" said J.L. David Smith, professor at the University of Minnesota's department of fisheries, wildlife and conservation biology. \"The best explication is time.\" [PAR] Many wildlife researchers believe that, historically, tigers inhabited much of Asia, and that various tiger subspecies naturally migrated and spread out over time. Pleistocene glacial fluctuations and geographic boundaries, however, probably made it too difficult for tigers to return to Africa. According to University of Minnesota conservation biology researcher Shu-Jin Luo, tigers did not disperse westward to India until 16,000 years ago"

Experiments with cathode-ray tubes, conducted by the British physicist Joseph John Thomson, proved the existence of the electron and obtained the charge-to-mass ratio for it. The experiments suggested that electrons are present in all kinds of matter and that they presumably exist in all atoms of all elements. Efforts were then turned to measuring the charge on the electron, and these were eventually successful by the American physicist Robert Andrews Millikan through the famous oil drop experiment. The study of the so-called canal rays by the German physicist Eugen Goldstein, observed in a special cathode-ray tube with a perforated cathode, let to the recognition in 1902 that these rays were positively charged particles (protons ). Finally, years later in 1932 the British physicist James Chadwick discovered another particle in the nucleus that had no charge, and for this reason was named neutron.

They would seem to be heavier, but the atoms are actually lighter. [PAR] Answer 4: [PAR] More are always being discovered or manufactured. The heaviest element commonly found in nature is uranium, although plutonium is heavier. [PAR] That said, white dwarf stars are composed of electron degenerate matter - matter compressed so much (by gravity) that the electrons can't bond to the electron shells of the atoms, and the chemical and physical properties of such a material are essentially those of a metal.

Of course, the elements composing white dwarf stars are things like carbon, oxygen, and other things that aren't normally metals at all at Earth-like conditions!

(In 95 to 99% of right-handed people, language centers are in the left hemisphere, and up to 70% of left-handed people also have left-hemisphere language dominance.) According to the traditional classification scheme, each form of aphasia is caused by damage to a different part of the left hemisphere of the brain. This damage affects one or more of the basic language functions: speech, naming (the ability to identify an object, color, or other item with an appropriate word or term), repetition (the ability to repeat words, phrases, and sentences), hearing comprehension (the ability to understand spoken language), reading (the ability to understand written words and their meaning), and writing (the ability to communicate and record events with text).

[PAR] Information about the American Pronghorn or Antelope: [PAR] The American Pronghorn (also called the American Antelope or Pronghorn Antelope although it is actually not an antelope) is a herbivorous mammal native to the open grasslands, plains and deserts of the western part of North America. Pronghorns are known for their large migration patterns, which are the longest land migration (over 150 miles each way) in the continental United States. They are also the fastest land animal in all of North America with top speeds reaching nearly 60 miles an hour. While they cannot run as fast as the cheetah, they can maintain their speeds for a greater duration. Pronghorns have excellent eyesight and can spot predators from quite a distance. Unfortunately, the traditional migratory routes of the pronghorn have been disrupted by the greatly increased expansion of natural gas drilling. "

There is some evidence that the early popes, including Peter , appointed their own successors, though this practice evidently failed to gain support. Subsequently, the election of the bishop of Rome (the pope) mirrored the election process for bishops in other towns: the local clergy were the electors; neighbouring bishops acted as presidents of the assembly and judges of the election; and the laity indicated their approval or disapproval more or less tumultuously. Elections were sometimes challenged or disrupted; as early as 217, a schism occurred and rival popes were elected (see antipope ). After the Roman emperor Constantine legalized Christianity in the early 4th century, the emperor assumed a role in the election, often presiding over the process and at times imposing a candidate. In the 6th century the Byzantine emperor Justinian I asserted that the newly elected pope could not be consecrated until his election had been confirmed by the emperor. ",

[PAR] A samovar is a device traditionally used to heat and boil water for tea.

The name can be loosely translated into English as \"self-boiler\". Samovars are made from metal and consist of a large urn-shaped container and a metal pipe running vertically through the middle. To boil the water inside a samovar, the pipe is filled with solid fuel such as pine cones, charcoals and wood chips which are set on fire. A small tea pot is used to brew a tea concentrate. The tea pot is often placed on top of a samovar to keep it heated with the passing hot air. "

It is highly reflective, and its way of moving at the slightest touch give it a quality of almost being alive.  In a previous age, the word \"quick\", was used to refer to things that were alive, not just things that were \"fast\".  (This is why we still hear references to \"the quick and the dead\".) [PAR] Mercury is the only metal that, at room temperature, remains a liquid.  It does not become a solid until it gets down to -38.72 degrees centigrade .  This means that it can be frozen with dry ice.  Yet it is still a brittle metal, even in its solid state.

[PAR] Abstract: [PAR] There is a strong oral tradition present in the field of violin pedagogy, in which the influence of a single teacher can be felt for many generations. Current violin teachers have a large responsibility to pass on to their students a strong foundation of technique and musicianship so that one day the students will be able to adequately teach both themselves and their own future students. Because of this responsibility, it is important for the violin teacher to be able to adequately pass on information in variety of ways in order to suit each individual student, thus enabling every student to gain something from their violin studies. A thorough understanding of the history of violin pedagogy is imperative to being an effective teacher. There have been many great violin pedagogues through the history of the violin, along with many important treatises on both playing and teaching the violin. Any of these treatises can serve as a valuable resource in the study of violin pedagogy. "

[PAR] Mulhac\u00e9n is the highest peak in EuropeThe Canary Islands and Greenland, which are politically attached to Europe, but which are geographically part of Africa and North America respectively, have higher peaks. outside the Caucasus Mountains and the Alps. It is also the third most topographically prominent peak in Western Europe, after Mont Blanc and Mount Etna, and is ranked 64th in the world by prominence. The peak is not exceptionally dramatic in terms of steepness or local relief. The south flank of the mountain is gentle and presents no technical challenge, as is the case for the long west ridge. The shorter, somewhat steeper north east ridge is slightly more technical. The north face of the mountain, however, is much steeper, and offers several routes involving moderately steep climbing on snow and ice (up to French grade AD) in the winter. [PAR] Mulhac\u00e9n can be climbed in a single day from the villages of either Capileira or Trev\u00e9lez, but it is more common to spend a night at the mountain refuge at Poqueira, or in the bare shelter at Caldera to the west.

A parasite is a plant or animal that needs another plant or animal to survive. As mistletoe grows on a tree and uses its roots to invade a tree's bark, which allows mistletoe to absorb the tree's nutrients. Sometimes, mistletoe can harm a tree and cause deformities in a tree's branches, but usually it doesn't kill its host. If the host dies, the mistletoe dies.

Once the white wines are fermented (Sherry is only made as white), they are transferred into barrels stacked up one on top of the other in what's called a Solera system. [PAR] The casks are not entirely filled with wine to allow contact with oxygen. A veil of yeasts develops at the surface of the wine, forming what's called the Flor (Spanish for Flower). This flor prevents the wine from turning into vinegar and provides the beverage with characteristic flavors of green apple, nuts, and spices. [PAR] Wine is progressively transferred from the top of the Solera system to lower casks. Wine is constantly blended to older wine with a complex mechanism that allows refined and progressive aging. [PAR] Depending on the style, the time spent under the flor veil varies. To stop the development of the flor, wines are fortified either to 15% or 17% ABV. [PAR] Sweetness also varies depending on the style. See the styles section below.

He made the drink in 1952 for an unknown local surfer who frequented his bar, the Blackwatch bar on Sunset Boulevard, and demanded one day that Galliano liqueur be added to his Screwdriver cocktail. The cocktail grew quickly in popularity, helped by some nifty marketing work by Galliano salesman George Bednar, peaking in the 1970s where it was a staple on many bars across the world \u2013 not just on the West Coast of the US. It has enjoyed a recent resurgence since Galliano returned to its original recipe. The classic Harvey Wallbanger is made by mixing Smirnoff No.21 Vodka and orange juice in a Highball glass with ice. Then slowly pour a measure of Galliano Liqueur onto the liquid so that the liqueur \u2018floats\u2019 on the surface of the drink. The visual punch is completed with a garnish of a maraschino cherry and a slice of orange.

Over the next four-and-a-half decades, he built up an impressive long record of ministerial service. He served first under Tory prime ministers as Junior Lord of the Admiralty and then, for two decades, as Secretary for War. During that period, Palmerston was chiefly known as a man of fashion, a junior minister without influence on the general policy of the cabinets he served. Around 1830, Palmerston defected from the Tories to the Whigs because of his support for Catholic emancipation and parliamentary reform. Earl Grey made him Foreign Secretary, a position in which he excelled, although he was headstrong and independent rather than instinctively diplomatic. Highly patriotic, Palmerston did not shirk from threatening the use of force in the national interest.

Palmerston successfully ended the war, and served as the Prime Minister for eight years despite his old age.

He responded successfully to the Indian mutiny of 1857, supporting a lenient approach in the face of British calls for hard treatment.

[PAR] Skeletal muscle [PAR] The tissue most commonly thought of as muscle is skeletal muscle. Skeletal muscles cover your skeleton, giving your body its shape. They are attached to your skeleton by strong, springy tendons or are directly connected to rough patches of bone. Skeletal muscles are under voluntary control, which means you consciously control what they do. [PAR] Just about all body movement, from walking to nodding your head, is caused by skeletal muscle contraction. Your skeletal muscles function almost continuously to maintain your posture, making one tiny adjustment after another to keep your body upright. Skeletal muscle is also important for holding your bones in the correct position and prevents your joints from dislocating. "

In most languages, the tittle of i or j is omitted when a diacritic is placed in the tittle's usual position (as \u00ed or \u0135), but not when the diacritic appears elsewhere (as \u012f, \u0249).

Its most prominent occurrence is in the Christian Bible at Matthew 5:18: \"For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled\" (KJV). The quotation uses them as an example of extremely minor details. The phrase \"jot and tittle\" indicates that every small detail has received attention.

Considerable savings were achieved in its construction over earlier cut-and-cover methods by using a flat roof with steel beams instead of a brick arch, and therefore, a shallower trench. [PAR] In Paris , the M\u00e9tro (Chemin de Fer M\u00e9tropolitain de Paris) was started in 1898, and the first 6.25 miles (10 km) were opened in 1900. The rapid progress was attributed to the wide streets overhead and the modification of the cut-and-cover method devised by the French engineer Fulgence Bienvenue. Vertical shafts were sunk at intervals along the route; and, from there, side trenches were dug and masonry foundations to support wooden shuttering were placed immediately under the road surfaces. Construction of the roof arch then proceeded with relatively little disturbance to street traffic. This method, while it is still used in Paris, has not been widely copied in subway construction elsewhere. [PAR] In the United States the first practical subway line was constructed in Boston between 1895 and 1897. It was 1.5 miles (2.4 km) long and at first used trolley streetcars, or tramcars. Later, Boston acquired conventional subway trains. New York City opened the first section of what was to become the largest system in the world on Oct. 27, 1904.

Reflecting all these characteristics, these Jutish invaders were said to have borne a banner bearing a white horse and it is further speculated that the symbol may have referred to the mythical horse Sleipner, which belonged to the god Odin, venerated by these Germanic warriors. The story of Hengist and Horsa further relates that the latter was killed in battle with the Celtic leader Vortigern at Aylesford, where a monument was raised in his honour, the White Horse Stone [PAR] near Maidstone. This standing stone is considered by some visitors to resemble a horse\u2019s head. Apparently the site has also been known locally as \u201cThe Ing\u00e1 stone\u201d, which presumably could be a corruption of the name \u201cHengist\u201d? An alternative school of thought postulates that the white horse of Kent is actually derived from the ancient white horses cut into chalk downs and stamped on the coins of more than one pre-Roman British king. However forged though, the link between the emblem of a white horse and the county of Kent was demonstrably established by the heraldic era. [PAR] As with Essex , the emblem of this early English kingdom was first recorded in print in the 1605 work \u201cRestitution of Decayed Antiquities\u201d by Richard Verstegen which included an engraving of Hengist and Horsa landing in Kent in 449 under the banner of a rampant white horse.

These haircuts symbolized religious devotion, group identity, and humility as well as the renunciation of worldly things and personal vanity. The practice may relate to ancient rites in which people in various cultures offered their hair as a religious sacrifice. Monks and nuns also take a vow of celibacy, and hair has historically been associated with eroticism and sexuality and as a means to attract the opposite sex.

            "context": "He would often call Nick's replacement, PC Mike Bradley , by his full name, Michael, whenever they sometimes met. At first, Greengrass was used as a comic relief character, but after some time Greengrass became a central character with his own intrigues and schemes. Claude had a brother called Cyril Isaiah Greengrass , who appeared a couple of times, and a sister, Isabelle Christie , widow of a West Indian cricketer Vivian Christie. Bill Maynard reluctantly left the series due to poor health, with the producers unwilling to take the risk of insuring him to be on set. The producers offered to have a departing episode written for him, but he declined and so the character's exit (to join his sister on a cruise in the Caribbean) was explained without his appearing. Maynard went on to reprise his popular role of Greengrass in the first series of The Royal. While Heartbeat is well-known for quickly forgetting characters who have departed, Greengrass is unusual in continuing to be mentioned by his former sidekick David Stockwell in subsequent series, as both Vernon Scripps and Peggy Armstrong have tried to use Greengrass's old tricks in their schemes. When Vernon first appeared in the episode Safe House he said that Greengrass had a lot to answer for. Greengrass's schemes often went wrong when it came to making money but he always managed to come up with another idea or two. ",

Years after Hoffmann's death, his life as a teller of tales fueled the musical imagination of French composer Jacques Offenbach (1819-1880). Offenbach's opera The Tales of Hoff-mann spins a fantasy around the writer and a number of his works. [PAR] One of Hoffmann's stories, \"The Nutcracker and the Mouse King\" (1819), intrigued French writer Alexandre Dumas (1802-1870). Dumas published a translated and freely adapted version of this story in French. Dumas's \"The Story of a Nutcracker\" (1844) charmed the director of Russia's Imperial Ballet, who decided to commission a work based on the story. He hired the French choreographer Marius Petipa and his Russian colleague Lev Ivanov to choreograph the dancing. Petipa and Ivanov outlined the stage action needed to tell the story. Then they handed over a specific set of instructions to the composer who had been commissioned to write the music for the ballet. Luckily for future ballet lovers they selected Pyotr Tchaikovsky, who at that time was already considered a rising star among Russia's composers. Hoffmann's complicated and somewhat frightening tale can hardly be recognized in today's productions of The Nutcracker. Petipa and Ivanov presented The Nutcracker as a delightful children's fantasy.

She is depicted in mythology, poetry and literature as a slim and beautiful goddess, a skillful huntress, and extremely talented with the bow and arrow. One of the most famous stories of Diana (Artemis in Greek mythology) took place during the Trojan War in the 12th century B.C. The epic 10 year Greek battle between Sparta and Troy raged when Paris of Troy took the beautiful Helen from her husband Menelaus, the king of Sparta. As the Greeks gathered their giant fleet of ships in the port of Aulis, the winds suddenly ceased and they could not launch.

[PAR] On a good day in the field, a birder might see a raft, a band, a host, a chime and even a kettle. But what exactly are they seeing? What would you call a group of flamingos, or a flock of eagles? Different types of birds have different collective nouns to describe large groups, and while many of the terms are obsolete, seldom used or just plain silly, they are still familiar to birders. Many of the terms are descriptive not only of the group of birds but also of their behavior or personalities , and birders who understand these esoteric words and can apply them to the appropriate birds will enjoy birding even more. [PAR] Names for Groups of Birds [PAR] Several collective nouns can apply to all bird species , such as flock, colony, fleet, parcel and dissimulation. Other not-so-common flock names that can be used for any type of bird include cloud, mass, collection or just plain group or throng.

            "context": "name Nationality Literary movement Relative(s)  Kathleen Mansfield Murry (14 October 1888 \u2013 9 January 1923) was a prominent modernist writer of short fiction who was born and brought up in colonial New Zealand and wrote under   the pen name of Katherine Mansfield, which is in itself a short form of her real name as she was born Katherine Mansfield Beauchamp. Mansfield left for Great Britain in 1908 where she encountered Modernist writers such as D.H. Lawrence and Virginia Woolf with whom she became close friends. Her stories often focus on moments of disruption and frequently open rather abruptly. Among her most well known stories are \"The Garden Party,\" \"The Daughters of the Late Colonel,\" and \"The Fly.\" During the First World War Mansfield contracted tuberculosis which rendered any return or visit to New Zealand impossible and led to her death at the age of 34.

            "context": "[PAR] Human blood pressure was first measured in 1847 by Carl Ludwig. He did this by inserting a cannula (narrow tube) directly into the artery of the patient. This cannula was then connected to a U-shaped manometer (a device that measures pressure) from which the pressure was measured. As you can imagine this method did not catch up with medical practitioners because there are a lot dangers involved in inserting a cannula into a patient's blood stream. [PAR] It was not until 1881, when Samuel Siegfried Karl Ritter von Basch invented the sphygmomanometer. His device consisted of a water-filled bag connected to a manometer. His device measured blood pressure fairly accurately without sticking anything into the body of the patient. [PAR] Scipione Riva-Rocci developed a more accurate sphygmomanometer which used mercury instead of water in 1896. This design was the prototype of the modern mercury sphygmomanometer. [PAR] Riva-Rocci's sphygmomanometer was spotted by the American neurosurgeon Harvey Cushing who seeing the potential benefit of the device sent the design to the United States in 1901. The design was modified for more clinical use and the sphygmomanometer became commonplace. [PAR] The word sphygmomanometer comes from the Greek word sphygm\u00f3s meaning 'pulse', and the scientific term manometer meaning 'pressure meter'. [PAR] The manual or classical sphygmomanometer consists of an inflatable cuff, a measuring unit (the mercury manometer), a tube to connect the two, and an inflation bulb also connected by a tube to the cuff.

[PAR] The Carry On films are Britain's longest running film series, comprising 31 films from 1958 to 1992. They are low-budget comedies, featuring a regular troupe of actors, whose humor is based largely on innuendo and double-entendre, with the humor becoming slightly more raunchy as the series progressed. By today's standards however, the jokes are all rather mild and often seem quaint. This is particularly true of Carry On Sergeant, the first film in the series, before the series formula had been perfected. [PAR] British institutions are often the target of the films' humor and here the jokes are aimed at National Service, which didn't end in Britain until 1960. The plot is simple and rather silly, while also being slightly more sentimental than the later films would become. The story takes place over the 10 weeks of basic training for a batch of new recruits in the army, beginning on their first day and ending when they graduate from their training. "

The medical term for the effect is cutis anserina or horripilation. [PAR] The formation of goose bumps in humans under stress is considered by some to be a vestigial reflex;  some believe its function in human ancestors was to raise the body's hair, making the ancestor appear larger and scaring off predators. The reflex of producing goose bumps is known as arasing, piloerection, or the pilomotor reflex. It occurs in many mammals besides humans; a prominent example is porcupines, which raise their quills when threatened, or sea otters when they encounter sharks or other predators.

When a goose's feathers are plucked, its skin has  [PAR] protrusions where the feathers were, and these bumps are what the human phenomenon resembles.

The first canal in the region seems to have been dug about 1850BCE, but that attempt, like many others, failed.  Desert winds blew in and clogged the canal.  About 150 years ago, Great Britain had a thriving trade with India, but without a canal, British ships had to make a long journey around the entire continent of Africa in order to trade with India.  A canal through the Isthmus of Suez would cut the journey from Great Britain to India by 6,000 miles.  An isthmus is a narrow strip of land connecting two larger pieces of land. [PAR] advertisement [PAR] A French company led by Ferdinand deLesseps made a deal with Egypt to build the Suez Canal.  After ten years of work, the canal opened in 1869.  The Egyptian ruler, Ismail, celebrated the opening of the Suez Canal by building a huge palace in Cairo.  Ismail treated royalty from around the world to a celebration in honor of the new canal.  The heavy spending for the celebration came at a time when the price of Egyptian cotton plunged. "

At that time, the college's teachings were based on those of Aristotle, but Newton preferred to read the more advanced ideas of modern philosophers such as Descartes and astronomers such as Galileo, Copernicus and Kepler. [PAR] When Newton arrived in Cambridge in 1661, the movement now known as the scientific revolution was well advanced, and many of the works basic to modern science had appeared. Astronomers from Copernicus to Kepler had elaborated the heliocentric system of the universe. Galileo had proposed the foundations of a new mechanics built on the principle of inertia. Led by Descartes, philosophers had begun to formulate a new conception of nature as an intricate, impersonal, and inert machine. Yet as far as the universities of Europe, including Cambridge, were concerned, all this might well have never happened. They continued to be the strongholds of outmoded Aristotelianism, which rested on a geocentric view of the universe and dealt with nature in qualitative rather than quantitative terms.

The story of Noises Off is that of a group of actors putting on a play called Nothing On. While Noises Off is a great play, it\u2019s safe to say that Nothing On is not. And while the performers you will see on stage are the best comedic stage actors of today (and many of them longtime Roundabout favorites), the actors they are playing definitely are not. In other words, you have the best of the best pretending to be somewhat terrible, working on a great play while pretending to be working on a terrible one. The layers of all this are simply delicious, and it all works so beautifully because Michael treats his characters with such great love and affection. These characters may not be great actors, but they certainly exhibit great bravery, as the adage that \u201cthe show must go on\u201d is put to the ultimate test as the play goes on. You can feel Michael\u2019s admiration for their rare breed of showmen in every hilarious line.

Antimony compounds are prominent fire retardants found in many commercial and domestic products. Certain alloys are valuable for use in solders and ball bearings. An emerging application is the use of antimony in microelectronics. Few biological or medical applications exist for antimony.

As a result, they are rarely found in open water and prefer to stay relatively close to the sea bed where they can explore complex environments such as oyster beds, seagrass meadows, and rocky reefs. Nevertheless, these fish are very curious and active, and in some cases even aggressive against other fugu or other fish.

[PAR] Previously, it was unknown how pufferfish inflation took place. Recently, however, Dr. Peter Wainwright completed his analysis on the series of muscle actions which allow a pufferfish to inflate. First, the pufferfish fills its mouth with water. Then, it seals its mouth using a special valve at the bottom of the mouth. This valve flaps upward and covers the entire mouth of the fish. Next, a branchiostegal ray (a modified gill arch) pushes the water down the esophagus into the stomach. The extremely elastic stomach then expands.

Reflecting all these characteristics, these Jutish invaders were said to have borne a banner bearing a white horse and it is further speculated that the symbol may have referred to the mythical horse Sleipner, which belonged to the god Odin, venerated by these Germanic warriors. The story of Hengist and Horsa further relates that the latter was killed in battle with the Celtic leader Vortigern at Aylesford, where a monument was raised in his honour, the White Horse Stone [PAR] near Maidstone. This standing stone is considered by some visitors to resemble a horse\u2019s head. Apparently the site has also been known locally as \u201cThe Ing\u00e1 stone\u201d, which presumably could be a corruption of the name \u201cHengist\u201d? An alternative school of thought postulates that the white horse of Kent is actually derived from the ancient white horses cut into chalk downs and stamped on the coins of more than one pre-Roman British king. However forged though, the link between the emblem of a white horse and the county of Kent was demonstrably established by the heraldic era. [PAR] As with Essex , the emblem of this early English kingdom was first recorded in print in the 1605 work \u201cRestitution of Decayed Antiquities\u201d by Richard Verstegen which included an engraving of Hengist and Horsa landing in Kent in 449 under the banner of a rampant white horse.

[PAR] Another variation of faggot is Pig's fry wrapped in pig's caul: the pig's fry and boiled onions are minced (ground) together, then mixed with breadcrumbs or cold boiled potatoes, seasoned with sage, mixed herbs and pepper, all beaten together and then wrapped in small pieces of caul to form a ball. They are then baked in the oven and are usually served cold.  [PAR] Production [PAR] The dish gained in popularity during the rationing in World War II, though its popularity has declined in recent years. Faggots are often homemade and are to be found in traditional butchers' shops and market stalls, though larger supermarkets generally stock the Mr Brain's brand of mass-produced faggot. This is a frozen food product available in Britain, made of liver and onions rolled into meatballs and served in a sauce. These differ significantly from traditional faggots, which have a coarser texture and contain far less water. [PAR] A popular dish is faggots and peas. This combination is common in the Black Country area of the West Midlands. "

[PAR] Thomas Chippendale [PAR] Thomas Chippendale (1718-1779), an English cabinetmaker, was one of the most distinguished of all furniture designers. His \"Director\" was the first comprehensive design book for furniture ever to appear, and it remains probably the most important. [PAR] The son of a joiner and the grandson of a carpenter, Thomas Chippendale was born at Otley, Yorkshire, on June 5, 1718. There is a tradition that as a young apprentice he made the dollhouse at Nostell Priory, Yorkshire, and also worked at Farnley Hall near Otley. He moved to London and married in 1748; his eldest son, also named Thomas, was born in 1749. In 1753 Chippendale went into partnership with James Rannie and took residence on St. Martin's Lane, where he remained until his death. [PAR] Chippendale's The Gentleman and Cabinet-Maker's Director appeared in 1754. This work, containing 160 plates and some descriptive notes, was intended to serve as a trade catalog and guide to clients. Its special significance is that it forms an important expression of the gay and lively rococo taste which became fashionable in the mid-18th century in the reaction against the somewhat ponderous character of early Georgian furniture.

The Screwdriver sits alongside the better-known Bloody Mary, Moscow Mule and Vodka Martini as one of four classic cocktails that pushed Smirnoff No. 21, and the previously unknown category of vodka, to dominate the global drinking scene.  Before World War II, fresh orange juice was only available in season, while canned juices tasted very different from the real thing. The Screwdriver benefited from new, better-tasting packaged orange juice that arrived in the late 1940s. The name, a carefully masculine title for what could otherwise have been perceived as a feminine drink, supposedly derives from wildcatters drilling exploration oil wells in (variously) California, Texas, Persia or Saudi Arabia. Feeling parched in the desert, the oilmen would stir vodka into their orange juice using the only available tool \u2013 a screwdriver. The Screwdriver travelled fast. Creatively promoted in Los Angeles, by 1949 it was on the menus in bars as far afield as Turkey; by the 1960s it was a standard bar call. The key to this classic combination is good quality orange juice, ideally freshly squeezed, which allows the clean taste of Smirnoff No. "

The land was later conquered by King Sobhuza I in the early 19th century as he relocated his capital from Zombodze in present-day Shiselweni, to Zombodze in the centre of Swaziland. "

Pronghorns are known for their large migration patterns, which are the longest land migration (over 150 miles each way) in the continental United States. They are also the fastest land animal in all of North America with top speeds reaching nearly 60 miles an hour. While they cannot run as fast as the cheetah, they can maintain their speeds for a greater duration. Pronghorns have excellent eyesight and can spot predators from quite a distance. Unfortunately, the traditional migratory routes of the pronghorn have been disrupted by the greatly increased expansion of natural gas drilling. ",

The tradition of St. Placid's mission to Sicily in 534, which first gained general credence in the eleventh century, though accepted as genuine by such writers as Mabillon and Ruinart, is now generally admitted to be mere romance. Very little more can be said in favour of the supposed introduction of the Benedictine Rule into Gaul by St. Maurus in 543, though it also has been strenuously upheld by many responsible writers. At any rate, evidences for it are so extremely doubtful that it cannot be seriously regarded as historical. There is reason for believing that it was the third Abbot of Monte Cassino who began to spread a knowledge of the Rule beyond the circle of St. Benedict's own foundations. It is at least certain that when Monte Cassino was sacked by the Lombards about the year 580, the monks fled to Rome , where they were housed by Pope Pelagius II in a monastery adjoining the Lateran Basilica . There, in the very centre of the ecclesiastical world, they remained for upwards of a hundred and forty years, and it seems highly probable that this residence in so prominent a position constituted an important factor in the diffusion of a knowledge of Benedictine monasticism.

Marvelously enacted by Michael Sheen (who played the role opposite Langella on stage as well), Frost is a chipper, ever-smiling glad-hander who stands in sharp opposition to his dour interview subject; indeed their initial meeting is set up like two opposing troops marching into battle. \u201cI\u2019ve never been challenged to a duel before,\u201d intones Nixon to Frost, whose smile quickly fades. Clearly, the former president welcomes the challenge.

This is a kind of unaged whiskey made by triple and sometimes quadruple pot-distilling a mixture of cereals, typically rye, corn and wheat with malted barley less commonly used. After the final distillation, the malt-wine leaves the pot still at around 47% alc./vol.: a relatively low distillation strength which yields a spirit that retains more of the malty flavours of its base ingredients. The first distillation is called 'ruwnat', the second 'enkelnat', the third 'bestnat' (actually malt wine) and the optional forth distillation 'korenijn'. [PAR] The second is produced in a very similar way to most London Dry gins. Neutral spirit (very high strength vodka) is redistilled with a recipe of botanical flavourings, most typically including juniper, coriander, caraway, orris, angelica.

The rest of the membrane lines the inner surface of the chest wall, covers the diaphragm, and is reflected over the structures occupying the middle of the thorax; this portion is termed the parietal pleura. The two layers are continuous with one another around and below the root of the lung; in health they are in actual contact with one another, but the potential space between them is known as the pleural cavity. When the lung collapses or when air or fluid collects between the two layers the cavity becomes apparent. The right and left pleural sacs are entirely separate from one another; between them are all the thoracic viscera except the lungs, and they only touch each other for a short distance in front; opposite the second and third pieces of the sternum the interval between the two sacs is termed the mediastinum.

Former Precious singer, Jenny Frost joined the group in January 2001 to replace Kerry Katona who quit when she became pregnant although Katona later replaced Frost when the group reformed in 2012. To date the group have had three UK number one singles; \"Whole Again\", the fourth best-selling single by a girl group of all time, \"Eternal Flame\", a song originally recorded by The Bangles, and \"The Tide Is High\", a song originally recorded by The Paragons and later by Blondie. They have also had two double-platinum number-one albums in the UK, their debut Right Now and its follow-up Feels So Good. They released their final studio album Ladies Night on 10 November 2003. As of April 2013, Atomic Kitten have sold over 10 million records worldwide. In April 2004, following the departure of Hamilton, the group announced their split, although they returned briefly a year later to release a new version of their single \"Cradle\". They also made one-off appearances in 2006 and 2008 to release charity singles. ",

Under the Broughton Rules a downed man was allowed 30 seconds to square off at a distance of 1yd (90cm) from the opponent, aided by handlers if necessary.  If the boxer failed to square off, the fighter was considered beaten.  Under the London Prize Ring Rules the boxer had to reach scratch (a mark located in the middle of the ring) unaided within 8 seconds after the 30-second time lapse; and a round ended when a boxer went down.  Under the Queensberry Rules, matches were divided into 3 minute rounds with 1 minute intervals of rest between them.  A contestant who remained down, either recumbent or on one knee, after 10 seconds lost the match.  The Rules also stipulated that matches be conducted in a roped-in square, called a ring, measuring 24ft (7.3m) on a side. [PAR] The last bare-knuckle Heavyweight Champion was the American John L.

Nevertheless, these fish are very curious and active, and in some cases even aggressive against other fugu or other fish.

Mounted robbers were widely considered to be socially superior to footpads. Such robbers operated in Great Britain and Ireland from the Elizabethan era until the early 19th century.

In the same time period in Australia, they were known as bushrangers. [PAR] Robbers as heroes [PAR] There is a long history of treating highway robbers as heroes. Originally they were admired by many because they were considered to be bold men who confronted their victims face-to-face and were ready to fight for what they wanted. The most famous English robber hero is the legendary medieval outlaw Robin Hood . Later robber heroes included the Cavalier highwayman James Hind, the debonair French highwayman Claude Du Vall, John Nevison, Dick Turpin and 'Sixteen-Jack' (John Rann) and the Slovak Juraj J\u00e1no\u0161\u00edk.

The earliest forms of the name Colchester are Colenceaster and Colneceastre from the 10th century, with the modern spelling of Colchester being found in the 15th century. In this way of interpreting the name, the River Colne which runs through the town takes its name from Colonia as well. Cologne (German K\u00f6ln) also gained its name from a similar etymology (from its Roman name Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium).

The Left Book Club was a highly successful publishing enterprise, and it developed into the  leading left-wing political movement of the 1930s in Britain. It attracted wide-ranging support, from Communists to left-wing Labourites and many Liberals.Its selections document the outlook of  most of the British Left of the 1930s and indicate the range of its interests. The author outlines the history of the club. The club is placed in the context of the political events of the 1930s and in the context of Gollancz's publishing career, his political beliefs, and his concern for  political education. Its organization as a book club is described and the range of its selection and activities is indicated. The last years of the Left Book Club, although of declining influence,  illustrate the course of the British Left from the disillusionment following the Nazi-Soviet Pact  and the split with the Communists to the concerns of the non-Communist Left during World War II and the election of the Labour government in 1945.

The house remains intact and stands today. Details about Jelly's early life are somewhat sketchy. What's clear however, is that at about the age of 8, Ferdinand received some basic but important formal guitar music lessons. Some historians have suggested that young Ferdinand did not take these initial lessons very seriously. However, the fact that a relatively short time later, he was playing piano in the 'Sporting Houses' of Storyville does suggest otherwise. ",

On December 20, 1860, South Carolina became the first state to secede from the Union. Many southern states soon followed and formed the Confederate States of America on February 4, 1861. Two years later, the country was in the middle of the American Civil War. The war claimed approximately 620,000 lives, which was two percent of the American population at the time. [PAR] President Lincoln gave the Gettysburg Address in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania on November 19, 1863 at the site of the Battle of Gettysburg. The battle, which occurred in early July of that year, resulted in approximately 51,000 casualties. [PAR] Lincoln was the second to speak at a dedication ceremony for a cemetery for the soldiers killed in the battle. Edward Everett, a well-known American orator and former vice-presidential candidate, spoke first, for approximately two hours. President Lincoln followed him with less than 300 words. In his speech, Lincoln stressed the importance of honoring the human sacrifices that had been made. He declared, \u201cThe world will little note, nor long remember what we say here; but it can never forget what they did here.\u201d [PAR] The Civil War continued until the spring of 1865 when the North won the war. Throughout 1864 and 1865, President Lincoln worked with the Senate and the House to pass the 13th Amendment, which declared that slavery and involuntary servitude were no longer allowed in the United States and gave Congress the power to enforce this law.

The traditional liturgical language of the Roman Catholic Church is Latin, and in Latin, the first word of the first antiphon of the vespers service is plac\u0113b\u014d, \"I shall please.\" This word is taken from a phrase in the psalm text that is recited after the antiphon, plac\u0113b\u014d Domin\u014d in regi\u014dne v\u012bv\u014drum, \"I shall please the Lord in the land of the living.\" The vespers service of the Office of the Dead came to be called placebo in Middle English, and the expression sing placebo came to mean \"to flatter, be obsequious.\" Chaucer, for example, uses the phrase on two occasions. In the Summoner's Tale, a friar offers the following piece of advice: Beth war, therfor, with lordes how ye pleye. / Singeth placebo and 'I shal if I kan,' \"Be wary, therefore, how you deal with lords. / Sing 'Placebo' and 'I shall if I can.'\" Placebo eventually came to mean \"flatterer\" and \"sycophant.\" In the 1700s, placebo began to be used of prescriptions written by a physician solely to please a patient, as by satisfying the patient's desire to take medicine.

A refugee from the 1848 revolution in Paris, he accepted the post of Conductor of the long-established Gentlemen's Concerts in Manchester. In 1857, for the six months duration of a gigantic exhibition of art treasures, this Orchestra was augmented.

The traditional liturgical language of the Roman Catholic Church is Latin, and in Latin, the first word of the first antiphon of the vespers service is plac\u0113b\u014d, \"I shall please.\" This word is taken from a phrase in the psalm text that is recited after the antiphon, plac\u0113b\u014d Domin\u014d in regi\u014dne v\u012bv\u014drum, \"I shall please the Lord in the land of the living.\" The vespers service of the Office of the Dead came to be called placebo in Middle English, and the expression sing placebo came to mean \"to flatter, be obsequious.\" Chaucer, for example, uses the phrase on two occasions. In the Summoner's Tale, a friar offers the following piece of advice: Beth war, therfor, with lordes how ye pleye. / Singeth placebo and 'I shal if I kan,' \"Be wary, therefore, how you deal with lords. / Sing 'Placebo' and 'I shall if I can.'\" Placebo eventually came to mean \"flatterer\" and \"sycophant.\" In the 1700s, placebo began to be used of prescriptions written by a physician solely to please a patient, as by satisfying the patient's desire to take medicine.

His \"Director\" was the first comprehensive design book for furniture ever to appear, and it remains probably the most important. [PAR] The son of a joiner and the grandson of a carpenter, Thomas Chippendale was born at Otley, Yorkshire, on June 5, 1718. There is a tradition that as a young apprentice he made the dollhouse at Nostell Priory, Yorkshire, and also worked at Farnley Hall near Otley. He moved to London and married in 1748; his eldest son, also named Thomas, was born in 1749. In 1753 Chippendale went into partnership with James Rannie and took residence on St. Martin's Lane, where he remained until his death. [PAR] Chippendale's The Gentleman and Cabinet-Maker's Director appeared in 1754. This work, containing 160 plates and some descriptive notes, was intended to serve as a trade catalog and guide to clients. Its special significance is that it forms an important expression of the gay and lively rococo taste which became fashionable in the mid-18th century in the reaction against the somewhat ponderous character of early Georgian furniture.

In recent years the Algerian Government has halted the privatization of state-owned industries and imposed restrictions on imports and foreign involvement in its economy. Hydrocarbons have long been the backbone of the economy, accounting for roughly 60% of budget revenues, 30% of GDP, and over 95% of export earnings. Algeria has the 10th-largest reserves of natural gas in the world and is the sixth-largest gas exporter. It ranks 16th in oil reserves. Strong revenues from hydrocarbon exports have brought Algeria relative macroeconomic stability, with foreign currency reserves approaching $200 billion and a large budget stabilization fund available for tapping. In addition, Algeria's external debt is extremely low at about 2% of GDP. However, Algeria has struggled to develop non-hydrocarbon industries because of heavy regulation and an emphasis on state-driven growth. The government's efforts have done little to reduce high youth unemployment rates or to address housing shortages. A wave of economic protests in February and March 2011 prompted the Algerian Government to offer more than $23 billion in public grants and retroactive salary and benefit increases, moves which continue to weigh on public finances. Long-term economic challenges include diversifying the economy away from its reliance on hydrocarbon exports, bolstering the private sector, attracting foreign investment, and providing adequate jobs for younger ",

[PAR] Tradition has it that Yankee Doodle had its origins in the French and Indian War when New England troops joined Braddock's forces at Niagara. In contrast to the spit and polish of the British army, the colonials were a motley crew, some wearing buckskins and furs. Dr. Richard Schuckburg, a British Army surgeon reportedly wrote the tune ridiculing the Americans in the early 1750s. Some scholars believe it is a variant of the nursery rhyme Lucy Locket. [PAR] Despite the fact it began as ridicule, the colonials took the song for their own. Countless versions and parodies evolved, many of which made fun of their officers, including George Washington.

[PAR] Structure [PAR] There are a number of structural characteristics common to all cyclones.  A cyclone is a low-pressure area.   A cyclone's center (often known in a mature tropical cyclone as the eye), is the area of lowest atmospheric pressure in the region.  Near the center, the pressure gradient force (from the pressure in the center of the cyclone compared to the pressure outside the cyclone) and the force from the Coriolis effect must be in an approximate balance, or the cyclone would collapse on itself as a result of the difference in pressure.  [PAR] Because of the Coriolis effect, the wind flow around a large cyclone is counterclockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere.  In the Northern Hemisphere, the fastest winds relative to the surface of the  Earth therefore occur on the eastern side of a northward-moving cyclone and on the northern side of a westward-moving one; the opposite occurs in the Southern Hemisphere.   In contrast to low pressure systems, the wind flow around high pressure systems are clockwise (anticyclonic) in the northern hemisphere, and counterclockwise in the southern hemisphere.

A thorough understanding of the history of violin pedagogy is imperative to being an effective teacher.

It also marks the transformation of British writer W. Somerset Maugham from celebrated playwright to accomplished novelist. In The Moon and Sixpence, Charles Strickland is a respectable London stockbroker who decides in middle age to abandon his wife and children and devote himself to his true passion: art. Strickland's destructive desire for self-expression takes him first to Paris to learn the craft of painting, and finally to Tahiti in the South Pacific. The Moon and Sixpence remains a complex and engaging novel echoing Maugham's own struggles between artistic expression and public respectability, and between his public persona and private life. show more [PAR] Product details [PAR] 165.1                                     x 172.7"

This is largely attributed to the influx of spices into Whitehaven during the 18th century. During this time Cumbria was introduced to ginger, black pepper and nutmeg, as well as other foodstuffs such as molasses, sugar and rum. Many of these ingredients have been incorporated into some of Cumbria's local specialities, such as the spicy Cumberland Sausage. [3] [PAR] Ingredients [PAR] Edit [PAR] Most sausages are divided into links but the Cumberland sausage is one continuous rope-like coil. The sausage is typically filled with coarsely chopped pork and black pepper, and sometimes other ingredients such as herbs and other spices. The meat content is usually 85% - 98%. [3] However, the popularity of the Cumberland sausage has become so widespread in recent years that many large food producers started to mass-produce it and sacrificed its original quality with a meat content as low as 45%, containing emulsified rather than coarse-cut meat and being sold in thin links rather than thick continuous lengths. [3] [PAR] Protected Geographical Status [PAR] Edit [PAR] There was a campaign by some Cumbrian butchers [4] and meat manufacturers to have Cumberland sausage placed under a Protected Geographical Status classification under European Commission rules. This would provide the same protection as is afforded to Parma ham and Feta cheese . The association suggested that the criteria for the sausages should include a high meat content "

The medical term for the effect is cutis anserina or horripilation. [PAR] The formation of goose bumps in humans under stress is considered by some to be a vestigial reflex;  some believe its function in human ancestors was to raise the body's hair, making the ancestor appear larger and scaring off predators. The reflex of producing goose bumps is known as arasing, piloerection, or the pilomotor reflex. It occurs in many mammals besides humans; a prominent example is porcupines, which raise their quills when threatened, or sea otters when they encounter sharks or other predators. [PAR] Etymology  [PAR] The phrase \"goose bumps\" derives from the phenomenon's association with goose skin. Goose feathers grow from stores in the epidermis which resemble human hair follicles. When a goose's feathers are plucked, its skin has  [PAR] protrusions where the feathers were, and these bumps are what the human phenomenon resembles. [PAR] It is not clear why the particular fowl, goose, was chosen in English, as most other birds share this same anatomical feature. Some authors have applied \"goose bumps\" to the symptoms of sexually-transmitted diseases.  \"Bitten by a Winchester goose\" was a common euphemism for having contracted syphilis  in the 16th century.

Courtesy   of the day demanded that, when entering the home of a friend, no weapons could remain   concealed. It is logical that when the sgian achlais was removed from its hiding place,   the stocking top was a convenient place to display it, securely held by the garter. [PAR] A second theory holds that the sgian dubh evolved from the small skinning knife that   was part of the typical set of hunting or gralloch knives. Some of these do exist. There   is usually a butchering knife with a blade of 9-10 inches and a skinner with a blade of   only 3 1/2-4 inches. These gralloch knives usually had antler handles, and so do not fit   the term black in either color or carry. This theory does have two points in its favor,   however. First, many early sgian dubhs are fitted with antler or horn handles. Secondly,   the skinning and butchering of wild game after the successful hunt was usually undertaken   by the upper-class hunter's ghillie, literally \"boy\" in Gaelic, as in serving   boy. "

Unfortunately, Microwaves are strongly absorbed by sea water within feet of their transmission.  This renders radar unusable underwater. [PAR] Answered by:   Scott Wilber, None, President, ComScire - Quantum World Corporation [PAR] The reason is mainly because radar has a harder time penetrating large volumes of water.  Contacts made by submarines are often dozens of miles away, and radar would have to be EXTREMELY powerful to reach that far in water, while sound (a mechanical wave) can make it that far. [PAR] Also, radar is only an active system allowing for your detection by passive sensors.  Whereas sonar can be both passive and active.  You can listen to sounds made by other subs' propulsion without giving away your position.  That is very important in Anti-Submarine Warfare, and is why quieter submarines have an edge on survivability. [PAR] Then there's the prospects of electromagnetic jamming.  Sonar jamming wouldn't be practical, because it would reveal your position and wouldn't mask your propulsion signature very well.  The only way to mask your engine using audio countermeasures would be to generate a negative waveform of your signature and produce it in real time, which is very hard and also impractical. ",

            "context": "[3] It is not known how the Cumberland sausage came to acquire its special shape and taste. Historically, the sausage was more highly seasoned than it is today. This is largely attributed to the influx of spices into Whitehaven during the 18th century. During this time Cumbria was introduced to ginger, black pepper and nutmeg, as well as other foodstuffs such as molasses, sugar and rum. Many of these ingredients have been incorporated into some of Cumbria's local specialities, such as the spicy Cumberland Sausage. [3] [PAR] Ingredients [PAR] Edit [PAR] Most sausages are divided into links but the Cumberland sausage is one continuous rope-like coil. The sausage is typically filled with coarsely chopped pork and black pepper, and sometimes other ingredients such as herbs and other spices. The meat content is usually 85% - 98%. [3] However, the popularity of the Cumberland sausage has become so widespread in recent years that many large food producers started to mass-produce it and sacrificed its original quality with a meat content as low as 45%, containing emulsified rather than coarse-cut meat and being sold in thin links rather than thick continuous lengths. [3] [PAR] Protected Geographical Status [PAR] Edit [PAR] There was a campaign by some Cumbrian butchers [4] and meat manufacturers to have Cumberland sausage placed under a Protected Geographical Status classification under European Commission rules. This would provide the same protection as is afforded to Parma ham and Feta cheese . The association suggested that the criteria for the sausages should include a high meat content ",

He made the drink in 1952 for an unknown local surfer who frequented his bar, the Blackwatch bar on Sunset Boulevard, and demanded one day that Galliano liqueur be added to his Screwdriver cocktail. The cocktail grew quickly in popularity, helped by some nifty marketing work by Galliano salesman George Bednar, peaking in the 1970s where it was a staple on many bars across the world \u2013 not just on the West Coast of the US. It has enjoyed a recent resurgence since Galliano returned to its original recipe. The classic Harvey Wallbanger is made by mixing Smirnoff No.21 Vodka and orange juice in a Highball glass with ice. Then slowly pour a measure of Galliano Liqueur onto the liquid so that the liqueur \u2018floats\u2019 on the surface of the drink. The visual punch is completed with a garnish of a maraschino cherry and a slice of orange.

[PAR] My experience with Boyle\u2019s work has been relatively limited (so far). That said, one thing that his works seem to me to have in common is a great deal of energy. Those films of his that I have seen are kinetic, dynamic, and leap from the screen. Even when they are not all that I might want them to be, Boyle\u2019s movies keep me invested with their combination of intensity and vigorous storytelling. All of this is true for Trainspotting, a film that managed to hold my attention tightly for its entire duration despite the fact that it will probably never join the ranks of my personal favorites. [PAR] By the very nature of its subject matter\u2014namely, the lives and the relationships between a number of addicts\u2014one would expect parts of Trainspotting to be unpleasant, but Boyle does not simply decorate his film with moments of grim reality. Instead, he allows grim reality to dominate every scene. While he does not wholly condemn his characters, Boyle doesn\u2019t turn a blind eye to the consequences of their behavior either. Rather, he successfully manages to portray multiple horrors of crime and drug use without ever allowing his film to become melodramatic. Trainspotting may be frustrated and disillusioned, but it does not pair those feelings with moralization. For all their many faults, Trainspotting respects its characters enough not to sugarcoat their lives or to use them to make sweeping generalizations. "
