The film was originally intended to be a parody , but director Stevenson decided instead , to shoot an action comedy wuxia film that incorporates the hero 's journey narrative archetype for the lead character . The computer animation in the film was more complex than anything DreamWorks had done before . As with most DreamWorks animated films , Hans Zimmer ( collaborating with John Powell this time ) scored Kung Fu Panda . He visited China to absorb the culture and get to know the China National Symphony Orchestra as part of his preparation . A sequel , Kung Fu Panda 2 , was released on May 26 , 2011 , along with a television series , Kung Fu Panda : Legends of Awesomeness later that same year as a part of a franchise .

In addition to being Oregon 's highest mountain , it is one of the loftiest mountains in the nation based on its prominence .   The height assigned to Mount Hood 's snow-covered peak has varied over its history . Modern sources point to three different heights : 11249 ft , a 1991 adjustment of a 1986 measurement by the U.S. National Geodetic Survey ( NGS ) , 11240 ft based on a 1993 scientific expedition , and 11239 ft of slightly older origin . The peak is home to 12 named glaciers and snowfields . It is the highest point in Oregon and the fourth highest in the Cascade Range .  Mount Hood is considered the Oregon volcano most likely to erupt ,  though based on its history , an explosive eruption is unlikely . Still , the odds of an eruption in the next 30 years are estimated at between 3 and 7 percent , so the U.S. Geological Survey ( USGS ) characterizes it as `` potentially active '' , but the mountain is informally considered dormant ."}

He became a naval aviator , flying ground-attack aircraft from aircraft carriers . During the Vietnam War , he was almost killed in the 1967 USS Forrestal fire . In October 1967 , while on a bombing mission over Hanoi , he was shot down , seriously injured , and captured by the North Vietnamese . He was a prisoner of war until 1973 . McCain experienced episodes of torture , and refused an out-of-sequence early repatriation offer . His war wounds have left him with lifelong physical limitations .   He retired from the Navy as a captain in 1981 and moved to Arizona , where he entered politics . Elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1982 , McCain served two terms . He was first elected to the U.S. Senate in 1986 , winning re-election easily five times , most recently in 2016 . While generally adhering to conservative principles , McCain at times has had a media reputation as a `` maverick '' for his willingness to disagree with his party on certain issues . After being investigated and largely exonerated in a political influence scandal of the 1980s as a member of the Keating Five , he made campaign finance reform one of his signature concerns , eventually gaining passage of the McCain -- Feingold Act in 2002 . He is also known for his work in the 1990s to restore diplomatic relations with Vietnam , and for his belief that the Iraq War should have been fought to a successful conclusion . McCain has chaired the Senate Commerce Committee , opposed spending that he considered to be pork barrel , and played a key role in alleviating a crisis over judicial nominations with the bi-partisan group known as the Gang of 14 .   McCain ran for the Republican nomination in 2000 but lost a heated primary season contest to George W. Bush of Texas . He secured the nomination in 2008 after coming back from early reversals , but was defeated by Democratic candidate Barack Obama in the general election , losing by a 365 -- 173 electoral college margin and by 53 -- 46 % in the popular vote . He subsequently adopted more orthodox conservative stances and attitudes and largely opposed actions of the Obama administration , especially in regard to foreign policy matters . By 2013 , however , he had become a key figure in the Senate for negotiating deals on certain issues in an otherwise partisan environment . In 2015 , McCain became chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee ."}
