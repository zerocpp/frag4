The computer animation in the film was more complex than anything DreamWorks had done before . As with most DreamWorks animated films , Hans Zimmer ( collaborating with John Powell this time ) scored Kung Fu Panda . He visited China to absorb the culture and get to know the China National Symphony Orchestra as part of his preparation . A sequel , Kung Fu Panda 2 , was released on May 26 , 2011 , along with a television series , Kung Fu Panda : Legends of Awesomeness later that same year as a part of a franchise .

In addition to being Oregon 's highest mountain , it is one of the loftiest mountains in the nation based on its prominence .   The height assigned to Mount Hood 's snow-covered peak has varied over its history . Modern sources point to three different heights : 11249 ft , a 1991 adjustment of a 1986 measurement by the U.S. National Geodetic Survey ( NGS ) , 11240 ft based on a 1993 scientific expedition , and 11239 ft of slightly older origin . The peak is home to 12 named glaciers and snowfields . It is the highest point in Oregon and the fourth highest in the Cascade Range .  Mount Hood is considered the Oregon volcano most likely to erupt ,  though based on its history , an explosive eruption is unlikely . Still , the odds of an eruption in the next 30 years are estimated at between 3 and 7 percent , so the U.S. Geological Survey ( USGS ) characterizes it as `` potentially active '' , but the mountain is informally considered dormant ."}

McCain experienced episodes of torture , and refused an out-of-sequence early repatriation offer . His war wounds have left him with lifelong physical limitations .   He retired from the Navy as a captain in 1981 and moved to Arizona , where he entered politics . Elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1982 , McCain served two terms . He was first elected to the U.S. Senate in 1986 , winning re-election easily five times , most recently in 2016 . While generally adhering to conservative principles , McCain at times has had a media reputation as a `` maverick '' for his willingness to disagree with his party on certain issues . After being investigated and largely exonerated in a political influence scandal of the 1980s as a member of the Keating Five , he made campaign finance reform one of his signature concerns , eventually gaining passage of the McCain -- Feingold Act in 2002 . He is also known for his work in the 1990s to restore diplomatic relations with Vietnam , and for his belief that the Iraq War should have been fought to a successful conclusion . McCain has chaired the Senate Commerce Committee , opposed spending that he considered to be pork barrel , and played a key role in alleviating a crisis over judicial nominations with the bi-partisan group known as the Gang of 14 .   McCain ran for the Republican nomination in 2000 but lost a heated primary season contest to George W. Bush of Texas . He secured the nomination in 2008 after coming back from early reversals , but was defeated by Democratic candidate Barack Obama in the general election , losing by a 365 -- 173 electoral college margin and by 53 -- 46 % in the popular vote . He subsequently adopted more orthodox conservative stances and attitudes and largely opposed actions of the Obama administration , especially in regard to foreign policy matters . By 2013 , however , he had become a key figure in the Senate for negotiating deals on certain issues in an otherwise partisan environment . In 2015 , McCain became chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee ."}

He reigned as the undisputed world heavyweight champion and holds the record as the youngest boxer to win a heavyweight title at 20 years , 4 months and 22 days old . Tyson won his first 19 professional fights by knockout , 12 of them in the first round . He won the WBC title in 1986 after stopping Trevor Berbick in two rounds , and added the WBA and IBF titles after defeating James Smith and Tony Tucker in 1987 . This made Tyson the first heavyweight boxer to simultaneously hold the WBA , WBC and IBF titles , and the only heavyweight to successively unify them .   Tyson became the lineal champion in 1988 when he knocked out Michael Spinks in 91 seconds of the first round . He successfully defended his titles nine times , which included victories over Larry Holmes and Frank Bruno . In 1990 , Tyson lost the titles to underdog Buster Douglas , who knocked him out in the tenth round . Attempting to regain the titles , Tyson defeated Donovan Ruddock twice in 1991 , but pulled out of a fight with then-undisputed heavyweight champion Evander Holyfield ( who had defeated Douglas later in 1990 ) due to a rib injury .   In 1992 , Tyson was convicted of rape and sentenced to six years in prison , but was released after serving three years . After his release in 1995 , he engaged in a series of comeback fights . He won the WBC and WBA titles in 1996 , after defeating Frank Bruno and Bruce Seldon by knockout . With his defeat of Bruno , Tyson joined Floyd Patterson , Muhammad Ali , Tim Witherspoon , Evander Holyfield , George Foreman as the only men in boxing history to have regained a heavyweight championship after having lost it . After being stripped of the WBC title in the same year , Tyson lost the WBA title to Evander Holyfield by an eleventh-round stoppage . Their infamous 1997 rematch ended when Tyson was disqualified for biting Holyfield 's ears .   In 2002 , Tyson fought for the world heavyweight title again at the age of 35 , losing by knockout to Lennox Lewis . Tyson retired from professional boxing in 2006 , after being knocked out in consecutive matches against Danny Williams and Kevin McBride . Tyson declared bankruptcy in 2003 , despite having received over $ 30 million for several of his fights and $ 300 million during his career . At the time it was reported that he had approximately $ 23 million of debt .   Tyson was well known for his ferocious and intimidating boxing style as well as his controversial behavior inside and outside the ring . Nicknamed `` Iron , '' and `` Kid Dynamite '' in his early career , and later known as `` The Baddest Man on the Planet , '' Tyson is considered one of the best heavyweights of all time . He was ranked No. 16 on The Rings list of 100 greatest punchers of all time , and No. 1 in the ESPN.com list of `` The Hardest Hitters in Heavyweight History . '' Sky Sports rated him as `` the scariest boxer ever , '' and described him as `` perhaps the most ferocious fighter to step into a professional ring .

Loosely based on the German fairy tale `` Rapunzel '' in the collection of folk tales published by the Brothers Grimm , it is the 50th Disney animated feature film . Featuring the voices of Mandy Moore and Zachary Levi , the film tells the story of a lost , young princess with long magical hair who yearns to leave her secluded tower . Against her mother 's wishes , she accepts the aid of a handsome intruder to take her out into the world which she has never seen .   Before the film 's release , its title was changed from Rapunzel to Tangled , reportedly to market the film as gender-neutral . Tangled spent six years in production at a cost that has been estimated at $ 260 million , which if accurate , would make it the most expensive animated film ever made and the fifth most-expensive film of all time . The film employed a unique artistic style by blending together features of computer-generated imagery ( CGI ) and traditional animation while using non-photorealistic rendering to create the impression of a painting . Composer Alan Menken , who had worked on prior Disney animated features , returned to score Tangled .   Tangled premiered at the El Capitan Theatre on November 14 , 2010 , and went into general release on November 24 . The film was well received by critics and audiences alike . The film earned $ 591 million in worldwide box office revenue , $ 200 million of which was earned in the United States and Canada . The film was nominated for a number of awards , including Best Original Song at the 83rd Academy Awards .

The actor successfully auditioned for the role in 2012 and was told he had won the role on his birthday . Clausen began filming almost immediately and was initially contracted for three years . Clausen had to give up recording his podcast TOFOP at Seven Network 's request , as it was deemed a conflict of interest . He made his first screen appearance on 22 January 2013 .   Zac is portrayed as being honest , strong , non-judgemental and someone who lives his life to the fullest . Clausen said he and Zac shared some similarities , which he liked . Zac was introduced as Natalie Davison 's ( Catherine Mack ) former boyfriend . As he was the local prison 's education officer , Natalie asked Zac to watch out for new inmate Casey Braxton ( Lincoln Younes ) . This brought Zac and Natalie back together and they rekindled their relationship , which had ended when Zac was sent to prison in his twenties .   After he started teaching at the high school , Zac almost lost his job when student Holly Chapman ( Sacha Vivian-Riding ) developed an intense crush on him and then accused him of trying to start an inappropriate relationship with her . Clausen said the storyline was the most interesting that he had ever worked on . Exploration of the character 's background began when his family were introduced in late 2013 and Zac briefly became romantically involved with his sister-in-law Hannah Wilson ( Cassie Howarth ) . Zac later married Leah Patterson-Baker ( Ada Nicodemou ) and learned that he had fathered a son . After the break down of his marriage , Zac departed the Bay on 25 May 2017 ."}

Best known for creating the animated comedy South Park , Parker and Stone co-created the music with Lopez , the co-composer/co-lyricist of Avenue Q , and , subsequently , Frozen .   The Book of Mormon follows two Mormon missionaries as they attempt to share their scriptures with the inhabitants of a remote Ugandan village . The earnest young men are challenged by the lack of interest of the locals , who are preoccupied with more pressing troubles such as AIDS , famine , and oppression from the local warlord .   In 2003 , Trey Parker , Robert Lopez , and Matt Stone began developing the musical , meeting sporadically for several years after Parker and Stone saw Avenue Q. Parker and Stone grew up in Colorado , and references to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints had been commonplace in their previous works . For research , the trio took a trip to Salt Lake City to meet with current and former Mormon missionaries . Beginning in 2008 , developmental workshops were staged . The show 's producer , Scott Rudin , opted to open the show directly on Broadway .   The show opened on Broadway in March 2011 , after nearly seven years of development . The LDS Church issued a polite , measured response to the musical , and purchased advertising space in its playbill in later runs . The Book of Mormon garnered overwhelmingly positive critical responses , and set records in ticket sales for the Eugene O'Neill Theatre . The show was awarded nine Tony Awards , one of which was for Best Musical , and a Grammy Award for Best Musical Theater Album . The original Broadway cast recording became the highest-charting Broadway cast album in over four decades , reaching number three on the Billboard charts . In 2013 , the musical premiered in the West End . Since then , it has staged two US national tours . An Australian production opened in Melbourne and a Swedish production opened in Stockholm in 2017 ."}

She has stated that as the FN 's immigration policies are better known to voters , she focuses her campaigning on the party 's economic and social programme .   Described as more democratic and republican than her nationalist father Jean-Marie Le Pen , the previous leader of the FN , she has attemted to detoxify and soften the party 's image , based on reformulation of policy positions , and expulsion of members accused of racism , antisemitism , or pétainism , including her father . Marine Le Pen has also relaxed some political positions of the party , advocating for civil unions for same-sex couples instead of her party 's previous opposition to legal recognition of same-sex partnerships , accepting unconditional abortion and withdrawing the death penalty from her platform .   On economic policy , Le Pen favours protectionism as an alternative to free trade . She supports economic nationalism , the separation of investment and retail banking , and energy diversification , and is opposed to the privatization of public services and social security , speculation on international commodity markets , and the Common Agricultural Policy .   Le Pen is opposed to globalization , which she blames for various negative economic trends , and opposes European Union supranationalism and federalism , instead favouring a loosely confederate ` Europe of the Nations ' .

Following the beginning of the Arab Spring and the European migrant crisis , she called for France to withdraw from the Schengen Area and reinstate border controls .

Pierre lives in Washington , DC , where the Inter-American Development Bank is based , and is an advisor for the Bank regarding Haiti . In the midst of a political crisis following the resignation of Prime Minister Rosny Smarth , Pierre was nominated as Prime Minister by President Préval in 1997 , but the Chamber of Deputies rejected the nomination on August 26 , 1997 , with 43 votes against him , nine in favor , and eight abstaining . Pierre 's inability to demonstrate that his grandparents were of Haitian nationality by presenting their birth certificates and his support for an economic plan that involved privatization and large-scale lay-offs of state employees contributed to his defeat .   After Prime Minister Jacques-Édouard Alexis was defeated in a vote of no confidence on April 12 , 2008 , Préval nominated Pierre as Prime Minister for a second time on April 27 , 2008 . In Les Cayes on May 5 , leaders of the riots against high food prices that had occurred in April demanded that a new Prime Minister and government be installed within a week , threatening renewed violence if this did not happen .   The Senate approved Pierre 's nomination on May 7 , with 17 votes in favor , two abstentions and none opposed . The nomination still had to be approved by the Chamber of Deputies . In an Associated Press interview , Pierre emphasized the need for long-term strategies to deal with the deepening poverty caused by rising food prices .   The Chamber of Deputies rejected Pierre 's nomination on May 12 ; there were 51 votes against him and 35 in favor , with nine deputies abstaining . As a result , Préval had to nominate someone else . Opposition deputy Levaillant Louis Jeune said that the deputies `` did n't really believe in the plan that he had for the people of this country '' . Additionally , as in 1997 , questions arose about Pierre 's nationality documents .   Speaking at the Hotel Montana in Port-au-Prince on May 15 , Pierre alleged that corrupt deputies had prevented his nomination from succeeding because he had been unwilling to negotiate with them and satisfy their demands for money , projects , and positions in the government . He was dismissive regarding the nationality issue .   Since March 2016 Pierre is Foreign Minister in the cabinet of Fritz Jean ."}

The reserves figures denote identified resources as of 1 January 2015 , consisting of reasonably assured resources ( RAR ) plus inferred resources recoverable at a cost range of below 260 USD/kg U . The list also includes cumulative historical production figures .   The amount of ultimately recoverable uranium depends strongly on what one would be willing to pay for it . Uranium is a widely distributed metal with large low-grade deposits that are not currently considered profitable . As of 2015 646,900 tonnes of reserves are recoverable at 40 USD per kilogram of uranium , while 7,641,600 tonnes of reserves are recoverable at 260 USD per kilogram . Moreover , much of Canada , Greenland , Siberia and Antarctica are currently unexplored due to permafrost and may hold substantial undiscovered reserves . When and if reserves from such remote locations will become profitable remains to be seen .   Notes : Historical production for the Czech Republic includes 102,241 tonnes of uranium produced in former Czechoslovakia from 1946 through the end of 1992 . Historical production for Germany includes 213,380 tonnes produced in the German Democratic Republic from 1946 through the end of 1992 . Historical production for the Soviet Union includes the former Soviet Socialist Republics of Estonia , Kyrgyzstan , Tajikistan and Uzbekistan , but excludes Kazakhstan and Ukraine . Historical production for the Russian Federation and Uzbekistan is since 1992 only ."}

The uranium is legally owned by the Australian Government , and is sold internationally , having a large effect on the Australian economy . The mining has been controversial , due to the widespread publicity regarding the potential danger of nuclear power and uranium mining , as well as because of objections by some indigenous groups . This controversy is significant because it involves a number of important political issues in Australia : Native Title , the environment , and Federal-State-Territory relations .   Kakadu National Park is on the World Heritage List , both for its cultural and natural value , a rare feat because few sites are featured for both reasons .

Several hundred kilograms of uranium were also produced . Of the world 's proven estimated uranium reserves ( 5,404,000 tonnes ) , 31 % are held in Australia ( 1,673,000 tonnes ) , ahead of the second largest , Kazakhstan ( 12.1 % or 651,800 tonnes ) . In terms of production , Canada is the largest supplier to export markets , followed by Kazakhstan and Australia . Uranium mined in Australia is mainly for export . Australia exported 50,235 tonnes of uranium oxide concentrate in the five years to 2008 , worth A$ 2.9 billion .   Following the Japanese Fukushima nuclear disaster in early 2011 , many countries are scaling back their nuclear power production , with some setting deadlines for a complete shutdown of all nuclear power reactors . It is expected that this may impact on demand for Australian Uranium . However , State governments have now approved mine development in Western Australia and Queensland . But as of 2013 uranium prices are very low , and it is unlikely that any new projects will enter active development until the market improves .   Historically , many prospective Australian uranium mines have been constrained by active antinuclear opposition . For several decades uranium mining has been a major part of the Australian political landscape , with opposition groups citing the wide ranging environmental impacts , indigenous land access and nuclear proliferation as reasons for ceasing or restricting the industry . The debate has resulted in limitations on mining and export activities , with Federal and State governments occasionally backflipping on public policy .   As of 2015 , there are three operational sites for uranium mining in Australia : Olympic Dam ( BHP ) , Ranger ( ERA ) , and Four Mile ( Quasar Resources Pty Ltd and Alliance Resources Ltd ) ."}

It has also evolved particularities of its own in response to the unique nature and use of this material .   Historically , uranium has been mined in countries willing to export , including Australia and Canada . However , countries now responsible for more than 30 % of the world 's uranium production include Kazakhstan , Namibia , Niger , and Uzbekistan .   Uranium from mining is used almost entirely as fuel for nuclear power plants . Following the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster , the global uranium market remains depressed , with the uranium price falling more than 50 % , declining share values , and reduced profitability of uranium producers since March 2011 . As a result , uranium companies worldwide are reducing capacity , closing operations and deferring new production .   Before uranium is ready for use as nuclear fuel in reactors , it must undergo a number of intermediary processing steps which are identified as the front end of the nuclear fuel cycle : mining it ( either underground or in open pit mines ) , milling it into yellowcake , enriching it and finally fuel fabrication to produce fuel assemblies or bundles . This technologically complicated and challenging process is simple in comparison to the complexity of the market that has evolved to provide these three services ."}

Born in England , Norton spent most of his early life in South Africa . After the death of his mother in 1846 and his father in 1848 , he sailed west , arriving in San Francisco possibly in November 1849 . Norton initially made a living as a businessman , but he lost his fortune investing in Peruvian rice .   After losing a lawsuit in which he tried to void his rice contract , Norton 's public prominence faded . He reemerged in September 1859 , laying claim to the position of Emperor of the United States . Although he had no political power , and his influence extended only so far as he was humored by those around him , he was treated deferentially in San Francisco , and currency issued in his name was honored in the establishments he frequented .   Though some considered him insane or eccentric , citizens of San Francisco celebrated his regal presence and his proclamations , such as his order that the United States Congress be dissolved by force and his numerous decrees calling for a bridge crossing connecting San Francisco to Oakland , and a corresponding tunnel to be built under San Francisco Bay . Long after his death , similar structures were built in the form of the San Francisco -- Oakland Bay Bridge and the Transbay Tube , and there have been campaigns to rename the bridge `` The Emperor Norton Bridge '' .   On January 8 , 1880 , Norton collapsed at the corner of California and Dupont ( now Grant ) streets and died before he could be given medical treatment . At his funeral two days later , nearly 30,000 people packed the streets of San Francisco to pay homage . Norton has been immortalized as the basis of characters in the literature of writers Mark Twain , Robert Louis Stevenson , Christopher Moore , Morris and Goscinny , Selma Lagerlöf , and Neil Gaiman ."}

All of the minor leagues are operated as independent businesses . Most are members of the umbrella organization known as Minor League Baseball ( MiLB ) , which operates under the Commissioner of Baseball within the scope of organized baseball . Several leagues , known as independent baseball leagues , do not have any official links to Major League Baseball .   Except for the Mexican League , teams in the organized minor leagues are generally independently owned and operated but are directly affiliated with one major league team through a standardized Player Development Contract ( PDC ) . These leagues also go by the nicknames the `` farm system , '' `` farm club , '' or `` farm team ( s ) '' because of a joke passed around by major league players in the 1930s when St. Louis Cardinals general manager Branch Rickey formalized the system , and teams in small towns were `` growing players down on the farm like corn . ''   Major League Baseball and Minor League Baseball teams may enter into a PDC for a two - or four-year term . At the expiration of a PDC term , teams may renew their affiliation , or sign new PDCs with different clubs , though many relationships are renewed and endure for extended time periods . For example , the Omaha Storm Chasers ( formerly the Omaha Royals and Omaha Golden Spikes ) have been the Triple-A affiliate of the Kansas City Royals since the Royals joined the American League in 1969 , but the Columbus Clippers changed affiliations , after being associated with the New York Yankees from 1979 , to the Washington Nationals in 2007 and have been affiliated with the Cleveland Indians since 2009 .   A few minor league teams are directly owned by their major league parent club , such as the Springfield Cardinals , owned by the St. Louis Cardinals , and all of the Atlanta Braves ' affiliates except the Florida Fire Frogs . Minor League teams that are owned directly by the major league club do not have PDCs with the parent club and are not part of the reaffiliation shuffles that occur every other year .   Today , 19 affiliated minor baseball leagues operate with 244 member clubs in large , medium , and small cities , as well as the suburbs of major cities , across the United States , Canada , Mexico , and the Dominican Republic . Several more independent leagues operate in the United States and Canada ."}

This term is used in North America with regard to several organizations competing in various sports . They generally have lesser fan bases and smaller budgets .   The minor league concept is a manifestation of the franchise system used in North American sports , whereby the group of major league teams in each sport is fixed for long periods between expansions or other adjustments , which only take place with the consent of the major league owners . In Europe , and many other parts of the world , the football leagues have many divisions below the top-flight as part of the football pyramid . In other parts of the world there is usually either a system of annual promotion and relegation , meaning that clubs have no fixed status in the hierarchy , or there is only one professional league per country in each sport , rendering the major/minor distinction irrelevant ."}

By definition , a solar system body is a NEO if its closest approach to the Sun ( perihelion ) is less than 1.3 astronomical unit ( AU ) . NEOs include more than fourteen thousand near-Earth asteroids ( NEAs ) , more than one hundred near-Earth comets ( NECs ) , and a number of solar-orbiting spacecraft and meteoroids , large enough to be tracked in space before striking the Earth . It is now widely accepted that collisions in the past have had a significant role in shaping the geological and biological history of the Earth . NEOs have become of increased interest since the 1980s because of increased awareness of the potential danger some of the asteroids or comets pose , and mitigations are being researched . In January 2016 , NASA announced the Planetary Defense Coordination Office to track NEOs larger than 30 to 50 meters in diameter and coordinate an effective threat response and mitigation effort .   NEAs have orbits that lie partly between 0.983 and 1.3 AU away from the Sun . When a NEA is detected it is submitted to the IAU 's Minor Planet Center for cataloging . Some NEAs orbits intersect that of Earth 's so they pose a collision danger . The United States , European Union , and other nations are currently scanning for NEOs in an effort called Spaceguard .   In the United States and since 1998 , NASA has a congressional mandate to catalogue all NEOs that are at least 1 kilometer wide , as the impact of such an object would be globally catastrophic . In 2006 , it was estimated that 20 % of the mandated objects had not yet been found . In 2011 , largely as a result of NEOWISE , it was estimated that 93 % of the NEAs larger than 1 km had been found and that only about 70 remained to be discovered . , there have been 875 NEAs larger than 1 km discovered , of which 157 are potentially hazardous . The inventory is much less complete for smaller objects , which still have potential for large scale , though not global , damage .   Potentially hazardous objects ( PHOs ) are currently defined based on parameters that measure the object 's potential to make threatening close approaches to the Earth . Mostly objects with an Earth minimum orbit intersection distance ( MOID ) of 0.05 AU or less and an absolute magnitude ( H ) of 22.0 or brighter ( a rough indicator of large size ) are considered PHOs . Objects that can not approach closer to the Earth ( i.e. MOID ) than 0.05 AU , or are smaller than about 150 m ( 500 ft ) in diameter ( i.e. H = 22.0 with assumed albedo of 13 % ) , are not considered PHOs . NASA 's catalog for near-Earth objects also includes the approach distances of asteroids and comets measured in lunar distances , and this usage has become a common unit of measure used by the news media in discussing these objects .   Some NEOs are of special interest because they can be physically explored with lower mission velocity than for even the Moon , due to their combination of low velocity with respect to Earth ( ΔV ) and weak gravity , so they may present interesting scientific opportunities both for direct geochemical and astronomical investigation , and as potentially economical sources of extraterrestrial materials for human exploitation . This makes them an attractive target for exploration . As of 2016 , three near-Earth objects have been visited by spacecraft ."}

The possibility is of particular interest to astronomers under reasoning that the more similar a planet is to Earth , the more likely it is to be capable of sustaining complex extraterrestrial life . As such , it has long been speculated and the subject expressed in science , philosophy , science fiction and popular culture . Advocates of space colonization have long sought an Earth analog as a `` second home '' , while advocates for space and survival would regard such a planet as a potential `` new home '' for humankind .   Before the scientific search for and study of extrasolar planets , the possibility was argued through philosophy and science fiction . The mediocrity principle suggests that planets like Earth should be common in the universe , while the Rare Earth hypothesis suggests that they are extremely rare . The thousands of exoplanetary star systems discovered so far are profoundly different from our solar system , supporting the Rare Earth hypothesis .   Philosophers have pointed out that the size of the universe is such that a near-identical planet must exist somewhere . In the future , technology may be used by humans to artificially produce an Earth analog by terraforming . The multiverse theory suggests that an Earth analog could exist in another universe or even be another version of the Earth itself in a parallel universe .   On November 4 , 2013 , astronomers reported , based on Kepler space mission data , that there could be as many as 40 billion Earth-sized planets orbiting in the habitable zones of Sun-like stars and red dwarf stars within the Milky Way galaxy . 11 billion of these estimated planets may be orbiting Sun-like stars . The nearest such planet may be 12 light-years away .   Scientific findings since the 1990s have greatly influenced the scope of the fields of astrobiology , models of planetary habitability and the search for extraterrestrial intelligence ( SETI ) . NASA and the SETI Institute have proposed categorising the increasing number of planets found using a measure called the Earth Similarity Index ( ESI ) based on mass , radius and temperature . According to this measure , as of 23 July 2015 , the confirmed planet currently thought to be most similar to Earth on mass , radius and temperature is Kepler-438b . Scientists estimate that there may be billions of Earth-size planets within the Milky Way galaxy alone ."}

It orbits the Sun at a distance of 0.3 -- 1.0 AU once every 185 days . Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.53 and an inclination of 19 ° with respect to the ecliptic . The body 's observation arc by begins with its official discovery observation at Anderson Mesa .   is the second known Atira asteroid -- the first being the group 's namesake 163693 Atira -- which means its entire orbit lies within that of the Earth . Its orbital period is less than that of Venus , making it one of the closest known objects to the Sun , after Mercury . Due to its eccentric orbit , it crosses the orbits of both Mercury and Venus , which also makes it a Mercury - and Venus-crosser . It has an Earth minimum orbital intersection distance of 0.0392 AU which translates into 15.3 lunar distances ."}

The story is about an FBI officer ( Harvey Keitel ) investigating the murder of a would-be informant , attempts to contact the only person who knows the truth behind the killings - the dead man 's eleven-year-old son .   As the film opens , we learn that Benson , a New Yorker , has been entrusted with protecting the 11-year-old boy . The style of the film is intentionally ambiguous , and details about only obtained through the dialogue between the main characters , in many cases , in a way that only makes sense once later scenes are viewed . The boy , as is revealed later , is with Benson because his father had appealed for protection from the authorities in return for his testimony against a local mobster , Manzella . The title of the film refers to the location of the main characters , who live on an island that is remote enough from the mainland that fresh water must be shipped in . Also on the island is a mysterious convent of nuns who make a living producing what appears to be wine and food seasonings , mainly using the local plants . The convent is located high in the mountains , and takes its heat from the active volcano on the island .   Benson finds that his efforts to get the child to talk to him about the murder of his father , who was to be under protection at the time that he was killed ( the plot does not reveal when the killing took place ) are frustrated by the boy 's strong desire to exact his own revenge . From the actions of Manzella and others , it becomes apparent that the boy was either present when his father was killed , or knows details relevant to the murder . Much of the story revolves around a cat-and-mouse style chase between Manzella and the boy . All the while , Benson must deal with the local police , who have themselves been infiltrated by Manzella 's organization ( this , we learn , was how the boy 's father was betrayed ) .   Romantic tension in the story is provided by Andie MacDowell 's character , Jessie . She has come to stay on the island with Benson , and their young daughter . Because of the secretive nature of the case , however , there is very little that Benson can reveal to Jessie about their reason for being in Italy , and this begins to place a strain on their marriage . Jessie regards the boy as her own , and attempts to find things to occupy his time while her husband and the local police are investigating Manzella . About midway through the story , we learn from the local detective , Giovanni Gigli , that the authorities are powerless to arrest Manzella , because he has the sympathy of those in the community of Naples , and it would be too dangerous to simply arrive in daylight with a warrant ."}

The film revolves around 15-year-old Sarah 's ( Jennifer Connelly ) quest to reach the center of an enormous otherworldly maze to rescue her infant brother Toby , who Sarah wished away to Jareth , the Goblin King ( David Bowie ) . With the exception of Connelly and Bowie , most of the film 's significant characters are played by puppets produced by Jim Henson 's Creature Shop .   The film started as a collaboration between Henson and Froud , with ideas for the film first being discussed between them following a screening of their previous collaboration , The Dark Crystal . Terry Jones of Monty Python wrote the first draft of the film 's script early in 1984 , drawing on Froud 's sketches for inspiration . Various other script-writers , including Laura Phillips ( who had previously written several episodes of Fraggle Rock ) , Lucas , Dennis Lee , and Elaine May , subsequently re-wrote and made additions to the screenplay , although Jones received the film 's sole screenwriting credit . Labyrinth was shot on location in Upper Nyack , Piermont and Haverstraw in New York , and at Elstree Studios and West Wycombe Park in the United Kingdom .   The New York Times reported that Labyrinth had a budget of $ 25 million . The film was a box office disappointment , grossing $ 12.9 million during its U.S. theatrical run . The commercial failure demoralized Henson to the extent that his son Brian remembered the time of the film 's release as one of the most difficult periods of his father 's career . It would be the last feature film directed by Henson before his death in 1990 .   Although it was met with a mixed critical response upon its initial release , Labyrinth has since gained a large cult following . A four-volume comic sequel to the film , Return to Labyrinth , was published by Tokyopop between 2006 and 2010 . In 2012 , Archaia Studios Press announced they were developing a graphic novel prequel to the film . In January 2016 , it was announced that a reboot was in development , which was later denied by screenwriter Nicole Perlman , describing it instead as a `` spin-off '' in the same fictional universe ."}

The iPhone 3G added 3G network support , and was followed by the 3GS with improved hardware , the 4 with a metal chassis , higher display resolution and front-facing camera , and the 4S with improved hardware and the voice assistant Siri . The iPhone 5 featured a taller , 4-inch display and Apple 's newly introduced Lightning connector . In 2013 , Apple released the 5S with improved hardware and a fingerprint reader , and the lower-cost 5C , a version of the 5 with colored plastic casings instead of metal . They were followed by the larger iPhone 6 , with models featuring 4.7 and 5.5-inch displays . The iPhone 6S was introduced the following year , which featured hardware upgrades and support for pressure-sensitive touch inputs , as well as the SE -- which featured hardware from the 6S but the smaller form factor of the 5S . In 2016 , Apple unveiled the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus , which add water resistance , improved system and graphics performance , a new rear dual-camera setup on the Plus model , and new color options , while removing the 3.5 mm headphone jack found on previous models .   The original iPhone was described as `` revolutionary '' and a `` game-changer '' for the mobile phone industry . Newer iterations have also garnered praise , and the iPhone 's success has been credited with helping to make Apple one of the world 's most valuable publicly-traded companies ."}

Following a number of notable leaks , the iPhone 4 was first unveiled on June 7 , 2010 , at Apple 's Worldwide Developers Conference in San Francisco , and was released on June 24 , 2010 , in the United States , United Kingdom , France , Germany and Japan . It is the 4th generation of iPhone , succeeding the 3GS and preceding the 4S .   The iPhone 4 introduced a new hardware design to the iPhone family , which Apple 's CEO Steve Jobs touted as the thinnest smartphone in the world at the time ; it consisted of an uninsulated stainless steel frame which doubles as an antenna , with internal components situated between chemically strengthened aluminosilicate glass . The iPhone 4 also introduced Apple 's new high-resolution `` Retina Display '' ; while maintaining the same physical size and aspect ratio as its precursors , its liquid crystal display had a pixel density of 326 pixels per inch . The iPhone 4 also introduced Apple 's A4 system-on-chip , along with iOS 4 -- which notably introduced multitasking functionality and Apple 's new FaceTime video chat service . The iPhone 4 was also the first iPhone to include a front-facing camera , and the first to be released in a version for CDMA networks , ending AT&T 's period as the exclusive carrier of iPhone products in the United States .   It was succeeded as Apple 's flagship smartphone in 2011 by the iPhone 4S . However , iPhone 4 continued to be produced until 2013 .   The iPhone 4 received generally positive reception , with critics praising its revamped design and more powerful hardware in comparison to previous models . While it was a market success , with over 600,000 pre-orders within 24 hours , the release of the iPhone 4 was plagued by highly publicized reports that abnormalities in its new antenna design caused the device to lose its cellular signal if held in a certain way . Most human contact with the phone 's outer edge would cause a significant decrease in signal strength .   The iPhone 4 spent the longest time as Apple 's flagship iPhone model at fifteen months , and had the longest lifespan of any iPhone ever produced , spanning close to four years and available in some developing countries until early 2015 ."}

The theater was converted to a movie house eventually remodeled and reopened as a Barnes & Noble bookstore . The Chateau was originally opened on October 26 , 1927 . The architects , Ellerbe , said , '' We have given this town the finest theater of its size , bar none , in the U.S. ''   In April 1927 , Dr. Charles Mayo laid the building 's cornerstone . The structure was originally called the Chateau Dodge Theatre because the Dodge Lumber Company had previously occupied this site . With construction costs of a then-unheard-of $ 400,000 , the theatre opened on October 26 , 1927 , showing the movie `` Spring Fever . ''   The Chateau Theatre was one of Rochester 's first air-conditioned buildings , presenting plays , concerts , operas , silent and later talking movies , and vaudeville : In 1940 , 25 cents ' admission provided audiences three acts of music/magic/juggling , `` Pathé news , '' comedy , and a main show . Chateau headliners over the years included actresses Ethel Barrymore and Tallulah Bankhead , the husband-wife acting team of Lynn Fontanne and Alfred Lunt , cinema cowboy Tom Mix ; Mary , the rhinoceros co-starring in Johnny Ismuller 's Tarzan ; and bandleader Paul Whiteman ( `` The King of Jazz '' ) . From the 1940 premiere of Gone with the Wind through the 1980s Star Wars episodes , the Chateau provided Rochester the very best in cinema .   The Preservation Alliance of Minnesota calls the Chateau Theatre Minnesota 's `` last and best example of ` atmospheric theater . '' ' Its principal architecture is Art Deco , a design popularized first in Europe and later the U.S. ( most famously in Hollywood and Miami ) from the mid-1920s to the late 1930s .   The original theatre mezzanine and inner lobby are gone ; all that remains are the railings and doorways to the restrooms and lounge areas . Originally , the main theatre floor had raked seating ; that is , with the rows farther from the stage rising toward the rear . The theatre originally had 1,487 red velvet seats , compared to today 's `` theaters , '' which generally seat 200 at most .   The original film projection booth sits above the second floor balcony , hidden behind the giant Barnes & Noble mural . Because of the theatre 's historic nature and a desire not to disturb its decorative side walls -- which replicate an early French ( Normandy ) village -- the floor is attached only at the building 's front and back walls while also supported by main floor pillars . The castle , with 40 balconies and 20 ft turrets , resembles a 10th-century French castle ( chateau ) . Originally passageways extended for actors to appear at the numerous windows and balconies .   The theatre ceiling is still the same dark blue as the original . The constellations , which once twinkled as dramatic scenes gradually changed from day to night , are still visible although difficult to see because of the larger spotlights later installed by Barnes & Noble . In addition to a `` moon machine , '' also still present but no longer functioning is a cloud machine , once used to project shadows of clouds across the ceiling . The pipe organ playing for melodrama and silent movies was located on the west side of the current children 's book section ; organ pipes were housed in the castle gate . The proscenium arch at the top of the escalator rises above the Chateau Theatre 's former stage , which measured 33 ft across and along with the organ rose to audience eye level at the start of each performance . Along with multiple dressing rooms , backstage included metal stairs climbing five flights , with showers and toilets at every other level .   In 1979 the `` World Wide Friends of the Chateau '' was formed and was instrumental in preserving the theatre from demolition . Although the theatre was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980 , it closed on October 2 , 1983 , with the 1934 movie classic It Happened One Night , starring Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert . Following nearly eleven years of debate . negotiation , and ultimately $ 4 million of renovation , Barnes & Noble reopened the doors of the Chateau Theatre on July 1 , 1994 .   The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980 .   On January 2 , 2015 , the Barnes & Noble inside the Chateau Theatre closed ."}

The State Theatre seats 2,181 . It opened in 1921 and was considered the most technologically advanced and elaborate theatre in the United States . It was designed by Chicago architect J.E.O. Pridmore in a free Italian Renaissance style and boasted the first well-driven air conditioning system in Minneapolis . The original stage floor was glass , lit from underneath to create stunning visual effects . The opening night program included a silent film , newsreel and travelogue . A Wurlitzer pipe organ was installed in 1925 and concerts were held every day for 25 cents . The State 's neon marquee was installed in the '40s and runs the entire width of the theatre . Between 1921 and 1978 , the State Theatre was used primarily as a movie house , but also hosted vaudeville acts , concerts and ballet . The movie screen was the largest screen west of the Mississippi River at the time . `` Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid '' set a national record at the State in 1970 for the longest run in America , and the final picture show was `` Tommy '' on New Year 's Eve 1975 .   The theatre was built on the site of the first mansion constructed by T. B. Walker in 1874 for his family at 803 Hennepin Avenue . His home stood there for forty years until it was demolished to make way for the theatre complex .   From 1978 to 1989 , the building was the home of Jesus People Church . The historic exterior State Theater signage was removed and church signage was installed . Interior alterations were also made .   The Minneapolis Community Development Agency purchased the LaSalle Plaza block in 1989 , including the State , as part of the LaSalle Plaza development . After nearly two years of renovation at a cost of $ 8.8 million , the State Theatre re-opened in November 1991 with the Minnesota Opera 's production of Carousel . The restored proscenium spans almost the full width of the building and curves 100 feet above the stage . The six chandeliers in the house are original , as are the murals on the walls . Since the re-opening in 1991 , the State has hosted live Broadway touring productions such as Avenue Q , Sweeney Todd and Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat , concerts featuring Patti Smith and Gordon Lightfoot , author and adventure speaker series and films including the world premiere of the Minnesota-based movie , `` Grumpy Old Men . '' The theater was featured in the film `` Jingle All the Way '' with Arnold Schwarzenegger in 1996 . Hennepin Theatre Trust has been the owner and operator of the State Theatre since 2005 .   Historic Theatre Group 's original partner was Jujamcyn Productions . SFX ( now Live Nation ) bought Jujamcyn Productions in 2000 .

It is a rare Wyoming example of a cinema from the early 1950s . The building is notable for the turquoise-colored metal lattice screen that covers a pink metal facade , as well as for its tall neon pylon sign .   The Bischoff family was part of a Mormon group sent from Fountain Green , Utah , to settle in the Big Horn Basin of Wyoming . Dan Bischoff ( 1870-1936 ) bought the Armada Theater in Lovell in 1913 and converted it into a cinema . His son Hy took over the business on his father 's death and operated two Armada theaters . Determining to build a new cinema , Hy toured the mountain states region looking at other cinemas . The 1949 Villa Theatre in Salt Lake City particularly impressed Bischoff , and he modeled the Hyart 's lobby after the Villa 's . Bischoff designed his new theater and directed the construction . Owing to shortages of steel during the Korean War , Bischoff obtained salvaged rails from the mines at Bearcreek , Montana and had them fashioned into steel roof trusses .   The two story building measures approximately 224 ft deep by 70 ft wide , facing onto Main Street . The walls are structural clay tile faced with brick , while the lower portion of the street facade is faced with small brick-like slabs of rhyolite from Idaho Falls , Idaho . The upper part of the street elevation is covered with pink sheet metal and screened by an elaborate diagonal lattice of turquoise metal . An office and apartment are located on the second floor , with eight windows behind the lattice . Pink neon lights outline the facade behind the lattice . A tall pylon features a neon-lighted artist 's palette and the word HYART at a right angle to the street .   The interior features the original carpeting and painted scrollwork above paneling .

The orchestra level of the theater is depressed below ground level , allowing the roof to nearly touch the ground at the corners .

Best known for creating the animated comedy South Park , Parker and Stone co-created the music with Lopez , the co-composer/co-lyricist of Avenue Q , and , subsequently , Frozen .   The Book of Mormon follows two Mormon missionaries as they attempt to share their scriptures with the inhabitants of a remote Ugandan village . The earnest young men are challenged by the lack of interest of the locals , who are preoccupied with more pressing troubles such as AIDS , famine , and oppression from the local warlord .   In 2003 , Trey Parker , Robert Lopez , and Matt Stone began developing the musical , meeting sporadically for several years after Parker and Stone saw Avenue Q. Parker and Stone grew up in Colorado , and references to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints had been commonplace in their previous works . For research , the trio took a trip to Salt Lake City to meet with current and former Mormon missionaries . Beginning in 2008 , developmental workshops were staged . The show 's producer , Scott Rudin , opted to open the show directly on Broadway .   The show opened on Broadway in March 2011 , after nearly seven years of development . The LDS Church issued a polite , measured response to the musical , and purchased advertising space in its playbill in later runs . The Book of Mormon garnered overwhelmingly positive critical responses , and set records in ticket sales for the Eugene O'Neill Theatre . The show was awarded nine Tony Awards , one of which was for Best Musical , and a Grammy Award for Best Musical Theater Album . The original Broadway cast recording became the highest-charting Broadway cast album in over four decades , reaching number three on the Billboard charts . In 2013 , the musical premiered in the West End . Since then , it has staged two US national tours . An Australian production opened in Melbourne and a Swedish production opened in Stockholm in 2017 ."}

It is the sixth-most populous country with a population exceeding 201 million people . In terms of area , it is the 33rd-largest country spanning 881,913 km2 . Pakistan has a 1,046 km coastline along the Arabian Sea and its Gulf of Oman in the south and is bordered by India to the east , Afghanistan to the west , Iran to the southwest , and China in the far northeast , respectively . It is separated from Tajikistan by Afghanistan 's narrow Wakhan Corridor in the north , and also shares a maritime border with Oman .   The territory that now constitutes Pakistan is considered a cradle of civilisation that was previously home to several ancient cultures , including the Mehrgarh of the Neolithic and the Bronze Age Indus Valley Civilisation , and later home to kingdoms ruled by people of different faiths and cultures , including Hindus , Indo-Greeks , Muslims , Turco-Mongols , Afghans , and Sikhs . The area has been ruled by numerous empires and dynasties , including the Persian Achaemenid Empire , Alexander of Macedonia , the Indian Mauryan Empire , the Arab Umayyad Caliphate , the Delhi Sultanate , the Mongol Empire , the Mughal Empire , the Durrani Empire , the Sikh Empire , and most recently , the British Empire .   Pakistan is unique among Muslim countries in that it is the only country to have been created in the name of Islam . As a result of the Pakistan Movement led by Muhammad Ali Jinnah and the subcontinent 's struggle for independence , Pakistan was created in 1947 as an independent homeland for South Asian Muslims . It is an ethnically and linguistically diverse country , with a similarly diverse geography and wildlife . Initially a dominion , Pakistan adopted a constitution in 1956 , becoming an Islamic republic . An ethnic civil war in 1971 resulted in the secession of East Pakistan as the new country of Bangladesh . In 1973 Pakistan adopted a new constitution establishing , alongside its pre-existing parliamentary republic status , a federal government based in Islamabad consisting of four provinces and four federal territories . The new constitution also stipulated that all laws were to conform to the injunctions of Islam as laid down in the Quran and Sunnah .   A regional and middle power , Pakistan has the sixth-largest standing armed forces in the world and is also a nuclear power as well as a declared nuclear-weapons state , being the second in South Asia and the only nation in the Muslim world to have that status . Pakistan has a semi-industrialised economy with a well-integrated agriculture sector , and a growing services sector . The Pakistani economy is the 24th-largest in the world in terms of purchasing power and the 41st-largest in terms of nominal GDP ( World Bank ) . It is ranked among the emerging and growth-leading economies of the world , and is backed by one of the world 's largest and fastest-growing middle classes .   The post-independence history of Pakistan has been characterised by periods of military rule , and since 2008 a transition to democracy , amid conflicts with neighbouring India . The country continues to face challenging problems such as illiteracy , healthcare , and corruption , but has substantially reduced poverty and terrorism and expanded per capita income . Pakistan is a member of the United Nations , the Non-Aligned Movement , the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation , the Commonwealth of Nations , the ECO , the SAARC , the Developing Eight , and the G20 developing nations , Group of 24 , Group of 77 , and ECOSOC . It is also an associate member of CERN . Pakistan is a signatory to the Kyoto Protocol , the Paris Agreement , and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights ."}

First staged in 2011 , the play satirizes various Mormon beliefs and practices . The script , lyrics , and music were written by Robert Lopez , Trey Parker , and Matt Stone . Best known for creating the animated comedy South Park , Parker and Stone co-created the music with Lopez , the co-composer/co-lyricist of Avenue Q , and , subsequently , Frozen .   The Book of Mormon follows two Mormon missionaries as they attempt to share their scriptures with the inhabitants of a remote Ugandan village . The earnest young men are challenged by the lack of interest of the locals , who are preoccupied with more pressing troubles such as AIDS , famine , and oppression from the local warlord .   In 2003 , Trey Parker , Robert Lopez , and Matt Stone began developing the musical , meeting sporadically for several years after Parker and Stone saw Avenue Q. Parker and Stone grew up in Colorado , and references to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints had been commonplace in their previous works . For research , the trio took a trip to Salt Lake City to meet with current and former Mormon missionaries . Beginning in 2008 , developmental workshops were staged . The show 's producer , Scott Rudin , opted to open the show directly on Broadway .   The show opened on Broadway in March 2011 , after nearly seven years of development . The LDS Church issued a polite , measured response to the musical , and purchased advertising space in its playbill in later runs . The Book of Mormon garnered overwhelmingly positive critical responses , and set records in ticket sales for the Eugene O'Neill Theatre . The show was awarded nine Tony Awards , one of which was for Best Musical , and a Grammy Award for Best Musical Theater Album . The original Broadway cast recording became the highest-charting Broadway cast album in over four decades , reaching number three on the Billboard charts . In 2013 , the musical premiered in the West End . Since then , it has staged two US national tours .

'' These various influences were distilled into a diverse and psychedelic whole that made the Grateful Dead `` the pioneering Godfathers of the jam band world '' . The band was ranked 57th by Rolling Stone magazine in its The Greatest Artists of All Time issue . The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994 and a recording of their May 8 , 1977 performance at Cornell University 's Barton Hall was added to the National Recording Registry of the Library of Congress in 2012 . The Grateful Dead have sold more than 35 million albums worldwide .   The Grateful Dead was founded in the San Francisco Bay Area amid the rise of the counterculture of the 1960s . The founding members were Jerry Garcia ( lead guitar , vocals ) , Bob Weir ( rhythm guitar , vocals ) , Ron `` Pigpen '' McKernan ( keyboards , harmonica , vocals ) , Phil Lesh ( bass , vocals ) , and Bill Kreutzmann ( drums ) . Members of the Grateful Dead had played together in various San Francisco bands , including Mother McCree 's Uptown Jug Champions and the Warlocks . Lesh was the last member to join the Warlocks before they became the Grateful Dead ; he replaced Dana Morgan Jr. , who had played bass for a few gigs . Drummer Mickey Hart and nonperforming lyricist Robert Hunter joined in 1967 . With the exception of McKernan , who died in 1973 , and Hart , who took time off from 1971 to 1974 , the core of the band stayed together for its entire 30-year history .

Pianist Bruce Hornsby was a touring member from 1990 to 1992 , as well as guesting with the band on occasion before and after the tours .   After the death of Jerry Garcia in 1995 , former members of the band , along with other musicians , toured as the Other Ones in 1998 , 2000 , and 2002 , and the Dead in 2003 , 2004 , and 2009 . In 2015 , the four surviving core members marked the band 's 50th anniversary in a series of concerts that were billed as their last performances together .

Named after the 1950s United States working-class youth subculture known as greasers , the musical is set in 1959 at fictional Rydell High School ( based on William Howard Taft School in Chicago , Illinois ) and follows ten working-class teenagers as they navigate the complexities of peer pressure , politics , personal core values , and love . The score attempts to recreate the sounds of early rock and roll . In its original production in Chicago , Grease was a raunchy , raw , aggressive , vulgar show . Subsequent productions sanitized it and tamed it down . The show mentions social issues such as teenage pregnancy , peer pressure and gang violence ; its themes include love , friendship , teenage rebellion , sexual exploration during adolescence , and , to some extent , class consciousness/class conflict .   Grease was first performed in 1971 in the original Kingston Mines nightclub in Chicago ( since demolished ) . Once opened , Grease was immediately well received by the public because it was created for nostalgia about the 1950s and as an escape from the intense and ongoing political and cultural issues through the 1960s . It served as an entertainment to everyone , reminded the baby boomers about their teens years , rode on the rising popularity of rock music in Broadway , and shed light on cultural truths about America . The show centred around authenticity and rawness , as is rock and roll . It boldly confronted people about social norms and rightly portrayed teenage rebellion , angst , and sexuality . Since the first performance it has been successful on both stage and screen , but the content has been diluted and its teenage characters have become less Chicago habitués and more generic . At the time that it closed in 1980 , Greases 3,388-performance run was the longest yet in Broadway history , although it was surpassed by A Chorus Line a few years later . It went on to become a West End hit , a successful feature film , two popular Broadway revivals in 1994 and 2007 , and a staple of regional theatre , summer stock , community theatre , and high school and middle school drama groups . It remains Broadway 's 15th longest-running show . Aspects of the stage play would be incorporated into the production 's 2016 live TV musical ."}

The show 's title was taken from the song `` You 're the One That I Want '' from the 1978 screen adaptation of Grease .

He acted in more than 100 films in roles covering a wide range of genres , from light comedy to serious drama . In his later years , Curtis made numerous television appearances .   Although his early film roles were partly the result of his good looks , by the latter half of the 1950s he became a notable and strong screen presence . He began proving himself to be a fine dramatic actor , having the range to act in numerous dramatic and comedy roles . In his earliest parts he acted in a string of mediocre films , including swashbucklers , westerns , light comedies , sports films and a musical . However , by the time he starred in Houdini ( 1953 ) with his wife Janet Leigh , `` his first clear success , '' notes critic David Thomson , his acting had progressed immensely .   He achieved his first serious recognition as a dramatic actor in Sweet Smell of Success ( 1957 ) with co-star Burt Lancaster . The following year he was nominated for an Oscar for Best Actor in The Defiant Ones ( 1958 ) . Curtis then gave what could arguably be called his best performance : three interrelated roles in the comedy Some Like It Hot ( 1959 ) . Thomson called it an `` outrageous film , '' and a survey carried out by the American Film Institute voted it the funniest American film ever made . The film co-starred Jack Lemmon and Marilyn Monroe , and was directed by Billy Wilder . That was followed by Blake Edwards 's Operation Petticoat ( 1959 ) with Cary Grant . They were both frantic comedies , and displayed his impeccable comic timing . He often collaborated with Edwards on later films . In 1960 , Curtis played a supporting role in Spartacus , which became another major hit for him .   His stardom and film career declined considerably after 1960 . His most significant dramatic part came in 1968 when he starred in the true-life drama The Boston Strangler , which some consider his last major film role . The part reinforced his reputation as a serious actor with his chilling portrayal of serial killer Albert DeSalvo .   Curtis was the father of actresses Jamie Lee Curtis and Kelly Curtis by his first wife , actress Janet Leigh ."}

Donald is an anthropomorphic white duck with a yellow-orange bill , legs , and feet . He typically wears a sailor shirt and cap with a bow tie . Donald is most famous for his semi-intelligible speech and his mischievous and temperamental personality . Along with his friend Mickey Mouse , Donald is one of the most popular Disney characters and was included in TV Guide 's list of the 50 greatest cartoon characters of all time in 2002 . He has appeared in more films than any other Disney character , and is the most published comic book character in the world outside of the superhero genre .   Donald Duck rose to fame with his comedic roles in animated cartoons . Donald 's first appearance was in 1934 in The Wise Little Hen , but it was his second appearance in Orphan 's Benefit which introduced him as a temperamental comic foil to Mickey Mouse . Throughout the next two decades , Donald appeared in over 150 theatrical films , several of which were recognized at the Academy Awards . In the 1930s , he typically appeared as part of a comic trio with Mickey and Goofy and was given his own film series in 1937 starting with Don Donald . These films introduced Donald 's love interest Daisy Duck and often included his three nephews Huey , Dewey , and Louie . After the 1956 film Chips Ahoy , Donald appeared primarily in educational films before eventually returning to theatrical animation in Mickey 's Christmas Carol ( 1983 ) . His most recent appearance in a theatrical film was 1999 's Fantasia 2000 . Donald has also appeared in direct-to-video features such as Mickey , Donald , Goofy : The Three Musketeers ( 2004 ) , television series such as Mickey Mouse Clubhouse ( 2006 -- 2016 ) , and video games such as QuackShot ( 1991 ) .   Beyond animation , Donald is primarily known for his appearances in comics . Donald was most famously drawn by Al Taliaferro , Carl Barks , and Don Rosa . Barks , in particular , is credited for greatly expanding the `` Donald Duck universe '' , the world in which Donald lives , and creating many additional characters such as Donald 's rich uncle Scrooge McDuck . Donald has been a very popular character in Europe , particularly in Nordic countries where his weekly magazine Donald Duck & Co was the most popular comics publication from the 1950s to 2009 . Disney comics ' fandom is sometimes referred to as `` Donaldism '' , a term which originated in Norway ( Donaldisme ) ."}

In this story Donald and his nephews Huey , Dewey and Louie meet a parrot named Yellow Beak and they wind up searching for the lost treasure of Henry Morgan . Unfortunately for them Black Pete wants the treasure too .   The script was by Bob Karp and illustrated by Carl Barks and Jack Hannah . This story introduced the comic book personalities of Donald Duck and his nephews .   The storyline was originally developed for a Mickey Mouse feature cartoon ( under the title `` Morgan 's Ghost '' ) in which Mickey , Donald , and Goofy meet Yellow Beak and encounter Pete , but the cartoon was never produced . Disney historian Jim Korkis reports the notion of taking the unmade feature and adapting the storyline for publication as a comic book occurred when Dell Comics editor Oskar Lebeck `` was given permission to look through the Disney files of cartoon ideas that were shelved . He found the over 800 numbered sketches for `` Morgan 's Ghost '' and was instantly struck that most of the work had already been done in terms of visualizing the story . Lebeck felt it could easily be adapted into a Donald Duck comic book story . '' Hannah recalled John Clarke Rose , Story Research Director at the Disney Studio , '' ... took us to meet Eleanor Packer who I believe was in charge of Whitman/Western Publishing . They wanted us to draw 64 pages of a Donald Duck story . I suspect the reason we were chosen for this assignment was that it was a more story related project . We were doing all the Donald Duck stories for the shorts and doing all the story sketches at the time so I 'm just guessing that they probably felt we could work out this story as well , maybe even add in a few touches to help it flow properly .
